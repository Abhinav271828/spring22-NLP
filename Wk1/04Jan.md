# Introduction
Language processing can be divided into different stages. We can talk about language processing at the word level (tokenisation, PoS tagging, head-finding), the sentence level (parsing, chunking) or the discourse level (coreference). It also includes semantic processing (semantic roles, word sense disambiguation).  
Speech processing, similarly, has its own component processes – phonetic transcription, segmentation and prosody.

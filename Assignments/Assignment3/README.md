# The Code
There are three code files – `language_model.py`, `seq2seqmt1.py`, and `seq2seqmt2.py`.  

`language_model.py` contains the code of the LSTM language model and its associated dataset class.  

`seq2seqmt1.py` contains the code of the seq2seq model trained from scratch on the parallel corpus.  
`seq2seqmt2.py` contains the code of the seq2seq model with weights loaded from the LSTM trained in part 1.

David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen, and we're not going to show you any of it.
The truth of the matter is that the Titanic -- even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records -- it's not the most exciting story from the sea.
And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.
When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.
Most of the planet is ocean water.
The average depth is about two miles.
Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach, or we see images like this of the ocean, and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides, but you have no idea for what lies in there.
And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.
Most of the animals are in the oceans.
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea, at the bottom of the sea.
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places, than it is in the rainforests.
It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.
But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.
We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world.
We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras, and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself.
Here's a jelly.
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
It gets up to about 150 feet long.
But see all those different working things?
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
It's a colonial animal.
These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature.
And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.
If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that, put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals on the other side, those guys win hands down.
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.
Here's the X-wing death jelly.
The bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating.
We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.
They come in all different sizes and shapes.
Bill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.
And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space, that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.
You hear about giant squid and things like that, but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.
They're very little understood.
DG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.
You can actually see through his head.
And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.
They come right up to the submarine -- they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.
This is really a world within a world, and we're going to show you two.
In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.
This is kind of like an undersea rooster.
This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.
And then one of my favorites. What a face!
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.
And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing, is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this, in the world where they belong.
They don't catch them in a net.
They're actually looking at them down in that world.
We're going to take a joystick, sit in front of our computer, on the Earth, and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.
We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge, a 40,000-mile long mountain range.
The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.
And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there -- but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America, and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.
We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar, and this is one of those mountain ranges.
We're coming around a cliff here on the right.
The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases.
And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.
This is a volcanic ridge.
We're getting down further and further in scale.
And eventually, we can come up with something like this.
This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.
And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time.
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video, or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors, but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine.
This is what's called a hydrothermal vent.
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed, hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.
Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.
So that's all water under the sea -- a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.
And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.
And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism, water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor, come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.
We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.
We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.
This is one of these hydrothermal vents.
Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps, so the setting here is very dramatic.
BL: The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees C.
DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea, is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria.
And we started to wonder for a long time, how did it all get down there?
What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.
Not only is it coming out of the Earth -- so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life.
The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here.
All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.
And you can see how dense the population is.
These are called tube worms.
BL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.
But they have two types of gill structures.
One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water, another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria, which takes the hydrothermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.
DG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms.
Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.
Oh! Good going.
So, as soon as a crab touches them, they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.
There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology.
BL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.
Their foot is at about 200 degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C, so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.
That's how they like to live.
DG: This is a female of this kind of worm.
And here's a male.
You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight.
Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.
There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.
Here they go.
On one of the last dive series, we counted 200 species in these areas -- 198 were new, new species.
BL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.
And they disintegrate on the way up, so the imagery is critical for the science.
DG: Two octopods at about two miles depth.
This pressure thing really amazes me -- that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.
What we saw up till now was from the Pacific.
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here, and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!
And the same thing's going on over here.
What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab -- the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals.
And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.
And the crabs don't like it at all.
These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria.
So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.
On the back, you see this again.
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.
Those are all shrimp.
You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.
They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.
Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.
Those pillars get up to several stories.
So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.
They don't need the sun at all.
BL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp?
It's actually a light-sensing organ.
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.
The vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature -- and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.
DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today, as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.
This is the first time we've ever tried this any place.
We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.
We're moving up one of these pillars.
This one's several stories tall.
In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.
There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.
So all of these are individual homes for worms.
Now here's a closer view of that community.
Here's crabs here, worms here.
There are smaller animals crawling around.
Here's pagoda structures.
I think this is the neatest-looking thing.
I just can't get over this -- that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.
This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean, and it's coming out all from it.
It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
And animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here.
That's probably where we evolved from.
BL: This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found.
There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites.
Although the vent sites are short-lived -- an individual site may last only 10 years or so -- as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years.
DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.
There's a fish sitting here.
Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm, waiting for that worm to stick his head out.
BL: The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active.
The worms are growing inches per week!
DG: I already said that this site, from a human perspective, is toxic as hell.
Not only that, but on top -- the lifeblood -- that plumbing system turns off every year or so.
Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.
And then there's earthquakes, and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years, that completely wipes the area out.
Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.
You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again, higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.
Is it sensitive? Yes.
Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.
I'll end up with saying one thing.
There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea, in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.
It's an incredible story.
What we see when we look back in time, in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.
Everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms.
The continents move apart. They come back together.
Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.
El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.
What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.
It's just like music -- it really is just like music.
And what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say, "Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today."
It's absurd. It's just absurd.
So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it.
Learn to manage it.
The concept of preservation is futile.
Conservation's tougher, but we can probably get there.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

<title>Steve Keil: A manifesto for play, for Bulgaria and beyond</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Steve Keil fights the "serious meme" that has infected his home of Bulgaria -- and calls for a return to play to revitalize the economy, education and society. A sparkling talk with a universal message for people everywhere who are reinventing their workplaces, schools, lives.</description>
I'm here today to start a revolution.
Now before you get up in arms, or you break into song, or you pick a favorite color, I want to define what I mean by revolution.
By revolution, I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave.
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?
We need a revolution because things aren't working; they're just not working.
And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working.
You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.
I'm sick and tired of us being last.
And we are last place in so many things -- for example, social factors.
We're last place in Europe in innovation.
There we are right at the end, right at the bottom, last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.
We're last place in health care, and that's important for a sense of well-being.
And there we are, not just last in the E.U., we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.
And worst of all, it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.
We're the saddest place on Earth, relative to GDP per capita -- the saddest place on Earth.
That's social. Let's look at education.
Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD?
Last in reading, math and science. Last.
Business: The lowest perception in the E.U.
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.
Why as a result, what happens?
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.
And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies.
We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.
So if our engine's broken, guess what?
Last in Europe GDP per capita.
Last.
So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future.
We're unhappy, we have bad education, and we have the worst businesses.
And these are facts, guys.
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.
It's not.
It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.
So I think it should be really, really clear that our system is broken.
The way we think, the way we behave, our operating system of behaving is broken.
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends, for our family and for our future.
How did this happen?
Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?
I think we're last because -- and this is going to be drastic to some of you -- because we are handicapping ourselves.
We're holding ourselves back because we don't value play.
I said "play," all right.
In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.
Babies play, kids play, adults play.
We don't value play.
In fact, we devalue play.
And we devalue it in three areas.
Let's go back to the same three areas.
Social: 45 years of what?
Of communism -- of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing, inadvertently, creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.
And instead, what do we value?
Because it's shown the way we apply, generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context, which told us what in communism?
To be serious.
To be really, really serious.
It did.
Be serious.
I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground.
Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal, or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them.
I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life.
We have a serious meme running through.
It's a social gene running through us.
It's a serious gene.
It's 45 years of it that's created what I call the "baba factor."
And here's how it works.
Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!
But then what happens in step three?
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.
I'm going to give bebko to baba.
But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.
So what happens?
She passes that virus on to baby, and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system.
What happens then?
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years, that values rote learning, memorization and standardization, and devalues self-expression, self-exploration, questioning, creativity and play.
It's a crap system.
True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.
We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff.
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"
And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."
And we said, "He's five."
What a crime. What a crime.
And it's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we're creating mindless, robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.
But I'm sorry, the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.
We need adaptability, the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.
We don't need mechanized workers.
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets, to lever and just throw away.
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?
Autocratic -- do what I say because I'm the chef.
I'm the boss and I know better than you.
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.
Controlling -- you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone, don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet, don't be on I.M.
That's somehow unprofessional and bad.
And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued and you're not having any fun.
In social, in education and in our business, don't value play.
And that's why we're last, because we don't value play.
And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.
It can't be because of play.
Just play, that's a stupid thing."
We have the serious meme in us.
Well I'm going to say no.
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech -- that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution, that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.
Play: our brains are hardwired for play.
Evolution has selected, over millions and billions of years, for play in animals and in humans.
And you know what?
Evolution does a really, really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage.
Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.
Throughout the animal kingdom, for example: ants. Ants play.
Maybe you didn't know that.
But when they're playing, they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.
Rats play, but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better, skills.
Kittens play. We all know kittens play.
But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially.
They can still hunt, but they can't be social.
Bears play.
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer.
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.
It's the ones that play more.
And a final really interesting study -- it's been shown, a correlation between play and brain size.
The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.
But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players?
Yours truly: humans.
Kids play, we play -- of every nationality, of every race, of every color, of every religion.
It's a universal thing -- we play.
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.
Really cool term: neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.
And who are the biggest neotenists?
Humans. We play sports.
We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.
We play musical instruments.
We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around.
We're designed by nature to play from birth to old age.
We're designed to do that continuously -- to play and play a lot and not stop playing.
It is a huge benefit.
Just like there's benefits to animals, there's benefits to humans.
For example, it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala, in the area where it controls emotions.
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening.
As a result, what happens?
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.
We develop better decision-making ability if we play more.
These guys are facts.
It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe; it's cold, hard science.
These are the benefits to play.
It is a genetic birthright that we have, like walking or speaking or seeing.
And if we handicap ourselves with play, we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have.
We hold ourselves back.
Little exercise just for a second: close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play.
Imagine a world without theater, without the arts, without song, without dancing, without soccer, without football, without laughter.
What does this world look like?
It's pretty bleak.
It's pretty glum.
Now imagine your workplace.
Is it fun? Is it playful?
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.
Is it fun? Is it playful?
Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling, restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work.
We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.
"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work," or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.
He's going to think I'm not working hard."
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.
The opposite of play is not work.
The opposite of play is depression. It's depression.
In fact, play improves our work.
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals, there's benefits for play at work.
For example, it stimulates creativity.
It increases our openness to change.
It improves our ability to learn.
It provides a sense of purpose and mastery -- two key motivational things that increase productivity, through play.
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious, play doesn't mean frivolous.
You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing, he's serious about it, but he loves it.
He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.
A doctor might be serious, but laughter's still a great medicine.
Our thinking is backwards.
We shouldn't be feeling guilty.
We should be celebrating play.
Quick example from the corporate world.
FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.
If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great, they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.
What happens? They give better service -- not worse, but better.
And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled, how do the customers feel? They feel great.
And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends, which leads to more profit.
People, service, profit.
Play increases productivity, not decreases.
And you're going to say, "Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States, but it can't work in Bulgaria.
No way. We're different."
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.
One, play is universal.
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.
When I got there, we had zero happy customers.
Not one customer would refer us.
I asked them all.
We had marginal profit -- I did.
We had marginal profits, and we had unhappy stakeholders.
Through some basic change, change like improving transparency, change like promoting self-direction and collaboration, encouraging collaboration, not autocracy, the things like having a results-focus.
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.
I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that.
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?
Basically promoting fun.
Through promoting fun and a great environment, we were able to transform Sciant and, in just three short years -- sounds like a long time, but change is slow -- every customer, from zero to every customer referring us, above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders.
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"
Well we did win, every year that we entered, one of the rankings for best employer for small business.
Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys.
It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.
There's nothing holding us back, except our own mentality about play.
So some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play.
First of all, you have to believe me.
If you don't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something.
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it.
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.
Rediscover that because you're the leaders, the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.
You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.
You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it, your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.
You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.
I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you, and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.
I'm going to let you challenge authority.
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today.
We're not always right as leaders.
We're going to eradicate fear.
Fear is the enemy of play.
And we're going to do things like eliminate restrictions.
You know what, let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid.
Let them be on the Internet.
Let them be on instant messengers.
Let them take long lunches.
Lunch is like the recess for work.
It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends, you have a beer, you have some food, you talk, you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before.
Let them do it. Give them some freedom, and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.
We spend so much of our lives at the workplace, and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind, so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?
Is that all there was?"
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.
So in summary, we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave, but we don't need a workers' revolution.
We don't need a workers' revolution.
What we need is a players' uprising.
What we need is a players' uprising.
What we need is a players' uprising.
Seriously, we need to band together.
Today is the start of the uprising.
But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution.
You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives, our schools, and our work with play; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment; of how play promotes innovation and productivity, and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.
Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together, and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play, we can transform Bulgaria for the better.
Thank you.

<title>Andreas Schleicher: Use data to build better schools</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How can we measure what makes a school system work? Andreas Schleicher walks us through the PISA test, a global measurement that ranks countries against one another -- then uses that same data to help schools improve. Watch to find out where your country stacks up, and learn the single factor that makes some systems outperform others.</description>
Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education.
We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity.
But I want to tell you the story of PISA, OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds around the world, and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy.
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s, in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school.
You can see the United States ahead of everyone else, and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education.
But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.
In the 1980s, the global expansion of the talent pool continued.
And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.
So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.
In the '90s, it was 13th, and not because standards had fallen, but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.
Korea shows you what's possible in education.
Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today, and was one of the lowest education performers.
Today, every young Korean finishes high school.
So this tells us that, in a global economy, it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success, but the best performing education systems internationally.
The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do.
Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets, while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need.
And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives.
So with PISA, we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly.
And we took a very special angle to this.
We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school, but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations.
Now, some people have criticized us for this.
They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people, because we test students with problems they haven't seen before.
But if you take that logic, you know, you should consider life unfair, because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school, but whether we are prepared for change, whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented, to solve problems we just can't anticipate today.
And once hotly contested, our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.
In our latest assessment in 2009, we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy.
This chart shows you the performance of countries.
In red, sort of below OECD average.
Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia; Finland in Europe; Canada in North America doing really well.
You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile, and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance.
There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy.
But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture.
Educators like to talk about equity.
With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity, in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances.
And we see that in some countries, the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very, very strong.
Opportunities are unequally distributed.
A lot of potential of young children is wasted.
We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born.
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant, where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.
Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there, where performance is poor and there are large social disparities.
And then we can debate, you know, is it better to be there, where performance is strong at the price of large disparities?
Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity.
In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence.
These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all, a very important lesson.
And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people.
And ever since those results came out, policymakers, educators, researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems.
But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA, and I'm giving them a colored bubble now.
And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students.
If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes, you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?
But that's not what you see.
Spending per student only explains about, well, less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries, and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system, doesn't do particularly well.
What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results.
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson.
Let's look at this in greater detail.
The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth.
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well, and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.
And Korea also invests into long school days, which drives up costs further.
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop.
They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things.
All that costs money.
How can Korea afford all of this?
The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.
This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.
You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg, and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea, so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes.
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.
So they have invested all their money into there, and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once, and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well.
Students don't have long hours of learning.
And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently, and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.
Let's go back to the year 2000.
Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.
This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance.
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?
We spent a lot less on education, about 35 percent less on education.
So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive, has it become so much better?
And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries.
But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements.
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000, featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities.
And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.
Very disappointing results.
People were stunned by the results.
And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education, not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education was the center of the public debate.
And then policymakers began to respond to this.
The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.
A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education.
For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten.
PISA has transformed that debate, and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany.
Or traditionally, the German education divides children at the age of 10, very young children, between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers, and that mainly along socioeconomic lines, and that paradigm is being challenged now too.
A lot of change.
And the good news is, nine years later, you can see improvements in quality and equity.
People have taken up the challenge, done something about it.
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.
In the year 2000, Korea did already very well, but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.
They took up the challenge, and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students, you know what happens is disparities grow, and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction, but still, an impressive improvement.
A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools, turn around many of the lowest-performing schools, and raise performance by over half a school year.
And you can see other countries as well.
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system, raise quality and improve equity, and so did Hungary.
So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.
And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture, of economic factors, of social issues, of homogeneity of societies, and so on, these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.
It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population.
It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive.
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity, high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere?
Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale, but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share.
Everybody agrees that education is important.
Everybody says that.
But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority against other priorities?
How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers?
Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer?
How do the media talk about schools and teachers?
Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems, the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education, their future, more than consumption today.
And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it, but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school.
Those things really exist.
But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture.
The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success.
You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages.
You know, students are divided up, reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world-class standards.
But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.
If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe, parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed, and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.
When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics, students in North America would typically tell us, you know, it's all about talent.
If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort, and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.
High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices.
They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents, and they personalize learning opportunities.
High-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.
Every student knows what matters.
Every student knows what's required to be successful.
And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers.
High-performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them.
They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling, and how they structure teacher pay.
They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice.
And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers.
In bureaucratic school systems, teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.
High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.
They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable their teachers to figure out, what do I need to teach to my students today?
The past was about delivered wisdom in education.
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.
High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control -- sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education -- to professional forms of work organization.
They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.
They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices.
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.
High-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive.
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes, on provision.
The high-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher, the next school around their lives.
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA, but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools.
Every school succeeds.
This is where success is systemic.
And how do they do that?
They invest resources where they can make the most difference.
They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools, and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom.
Last but not least, those countries align policies across all areas of public policy.
They make them coherent over sustained periods of time, and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.
Now, knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve.
That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are.
That's where other forms of research need to kick in, and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing.
But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing.
And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems.
You know, some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards.
You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this.
But PISA has shown what's possible in education.
It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.
It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.
And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.
If we can help every child, every teacher, every school, every principal, every parent see what improvement is possible, that only the sky is the limit to education improvement, we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives.
Thank you.

<title>Rachel Pike: The science behind a climate headline</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 4 minutes, atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change, with her team -- one of thousands who contributed -- taking a risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key molecule.</description>
I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic.
And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries.
It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that.
And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics.
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study.
And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it.
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene.
But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet.
It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane.
And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.
Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing.
We blow it up and look at the pieces.
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.
Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car.
But still, we look at the pieces.
We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do.
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations.
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing.
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others.
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there, in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene, and of course, other things while we were there.
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest, from above.
And this is the tower from below.
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.
And this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people.
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff.
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements.
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering.
We have to get special flight clearance.
And as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs.
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board.
So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation.
It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject.
And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules.
And as a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.
So you can imagine the scale of the effort.
In each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers, in order to make headlines like these.
Thank you very much.

<title>Christopher deCharms: A look inside the brain in real time</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Neuroscientist and inventor Christopher deCharms demonstrates a new way to use fMRI to show brain activity -- thoughts, emotions, pain -- while it is happening. In other words, you can actually see how you feel.</description>
Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back, just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.
You can mimic what you can see.
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program, control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.
I'm going to tell you about that technology.
People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years.
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.
People envision this as being very difficult.
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.
It was terribly dangerous.
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.
But now, we have a real technology to do this.
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body -- but more importantly, we can look into his mind.
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain: the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.
Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time, it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain, we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information, and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing.
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.
They're watching their own brain activation, and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.
As they do it, in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.
This is an investigational technology, but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.
This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.
I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.
When you do, what do you want to control?
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.
But I want to leave with you the big question.
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into, using this technology, the human mind and brain.
Where will we take it?

<title>Beeban Kidron: The shared wonder of film</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Movies have the power to create a shared narrative experience and to shape memories and worldviews. British film director Beeban Kidron invokes iconic film scenes -- from Miracle in Milan to Boyz n the Hood -- as she shows how her group FILMCLUB shares great films with kids.</description>
Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form.
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant, teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet, human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable.
We are inveterate storytellers.
But where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world, do we offer communality of experience, unmediated by our own furious consumerism?
And what narrative, what history, what identity, what moral code are we imparting to our young?
Cinema is arguably the 20th century's most influential art form.
Its artists told stories across national boundaries, in as many languages, genres and philosophies as one can imagine.
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle.
During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media, now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.
We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation, not story, is king.
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified.
As a filmmaker, it worried me.
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.
What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they've come from and so few narratives of what's possible?
The irony is palpable; technical access has never been greater, cultural access never weaker.
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB, an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions.
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film, maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young.
Given the access to technology, even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board.
In the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the U.K., with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.
The films were curated and contextualized.
But the choice was theirs, and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.
The outcome, immediate.
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three, these young people discovered new places, new thoughts, new perspectives.
By the time the pilot had finished, we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join.
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."
It's a remarkable comment on slums, poverty and aspiration.
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema, find and pay for the print and the projectionist.
But for my father, the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends, "In order," he said, "to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation."
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan," slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.
Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it, I see young faces tilt up in awe, their incredulity matching mine.
And the speed with which they associate it with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature.
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government, we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
It shows how to do right, how to be heroically awkward.
It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor.
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic, there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.
And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.
In choosing "Hotel Rwanda," they explored genocide of the most brutal kind.
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.
And when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget, one child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked, "We already forgot, otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.
"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.
They celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white Britons, but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity, unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.
By now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white, subtitled, documentary, non-narrative, fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.
Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week.
From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands, until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country.
And although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary, what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life.
Some of our kids started talking with their parents, others with their teachers, or with their friends.
And those without friends started making them.
The films provided communality across all manner of divide.
And the stories they held provided a shared experience.
"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother, and "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother, the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.
Who was right, who wrong?
What would they do under the same conditions?
Was the tale told well?
Was there a hidden message?
How has the world changed? How could it be different?
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn't think were interested.
And they themselves had not known they cared.
And as they wrote and debated, rather than seeing the films as artifacts, they began to see themselves.
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.
In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.
Quite recently she told me that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions, it was these teenagers that fed the crew.
I was past 40 when my father died.
He never mentioned that journey.
My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.
After two years in hiding, my grandfather appeared in London.
He was never right again.
And his story was hushed as he assimilated.
My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.
I had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape," "Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."
It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure.
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud, and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt's wrist.
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding, that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history, or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning.
As one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz," "Every person should watch this, because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart."
We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?
Consider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.
Agree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson, offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together.
Each a piece of memorable art, each a brick in the wall of who we are.
And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.
And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human, and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.
We guessed that film, whose stories are a meeting place of drama, music, literature and human experience, would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.
What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers, fight, not on the playground, but to choose next week's film -- young people who have found self-definition, ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed.
Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young.
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
They are, like other young people, negotiating a world with infinite choice, but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes, yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
If we want different values we have to tell a different story, a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity, that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity, and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group.
Because when these people get home after a screening of "Rear Window" and raise their gaze to the building next door, they have the tools to wonder who, apart from them, is out there and what is their story.
Thank you.

<title>Ellen Jorgensen: Biohacking -- you can do it, too</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We have personal computing -- why not personal biotech? That’s the question biologist Ellen Jorgensen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening Genspace, a nonprofit DIY bio lab in Brooklyn devoted to citizen science, where amateurs can go and tinker with biotechnology. Far from being a sinister Frankenstein's lab , Genspace offers a long list of fun, creative and practical uses for DIY bio.</description>
It's a great time to be a molecular biologist.
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper.
By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros.
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector.
It has the power, potentially, to replace our fossil fuels, to revolutionize medicine, and to touch every aspect of our daily lives.
So who gets to do it?
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it.
But what about that guy?
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.
It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone, not just scientists and people in government labs.
The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate, it could really stimulate innovation.
Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are.
And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road, all these associated social, moral, ethical questions, and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.
So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff, do it hands-on?
I thought so.
So, three years ago, I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace.
It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab in Brooklyn, New York, and the idea was people could come, they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open, friendly atmosphere.
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess?
The press started calling us.
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy, the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein, and as a result, for the next six months, when you Googled my name, instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.
["Am I a biohazard?"] It was pretty depressing.
The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world, there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were.
They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did, more regulations, less resources.
But now, three years later, here's where we stand.
It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces, and this is just the beginning.
These are some of the biggest ones, and there are others opening every day.
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow, one in South Korea, and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of.
Let me take you on a little tour.
Biohackers work alone.
We work in groups, in big cities — — and in small villages.
We reverse engineer lab equipment.
We genetically engineer bacteria.
We hack hardware, software, wetware, and, of course, the code of life.
We like to build things.
Then we like to take things apart.
We make things grow.
We make things glow.
And we make cells dance.
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive, but, you know, sometimes when people think of us, the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety, bio-security, all the dark side stuff.
I'm not going to minimize those concerns.
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use, and, you know, you get something like synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology, it really compels you, you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups, because they have better infrastructure, they have better facilities, and they have access to pathogens.
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently issued a report on this whole area, and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative, and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community, and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics.
As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world, America, Europe, got together last year, and we hammered out a common code of ethics.
That's a lot more than conventional science has done.
Now, we follow state and local regulations.
We dispose of our waste properly, we follow safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.
You know, if you're working with a pathogen, you're not part of the biohacker community, you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
And sometimes people ask me, "Well, what about an accident?"
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
Now, it could happen, but I'm not going to plan my life around it.
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.
It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study, they're going to take my entire genomic sequence, all of my medical information, and my identity, and they're going to post it online for everyone to see.
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion.
The one I liked the best is, someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab, synthesize some fake Ellen DNA, and plant it at a crime scene.
But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk.
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well, what would anyone do with a personal computer?"
So this stuff is just beginning.
We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.
Let me show you what you could do right now.
A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street?
Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva, identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.
Looked like a ladybug, right?
It actually is a Japanese beetle.
And the same kind of technology -- it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool -- You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga, if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's.
In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome for mutations.
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's, and you can explore your ancestry.
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere, collect microbes, see what's up there.
You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water.
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.
You can do a lot of things.
You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular, and they look at social, ecological problems from a completely different perspective.
It's really cool.
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else.
There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
It just has to follow safety guidelines.
If you had spaces like this all over the world, it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech.
It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.
Why not personal biotech?
If everyone in this room got involved, who knows what we could do?
This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

<title>Geert Chatrou: A whistleblower you haven't heard</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: World champion whistler Geert Chatrou performs the whimsical "Eleonora" by A. Honhoff, and his own "Fête de la Belle." In a fascinating interlude, he talks about what brought him to the craft.</description>
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That was whistling.
I'm trying to do this in English.
What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling?
Well actually, I've [been] whistling since the age of four, about four.
My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family.
So I whistled along with him.
And actually, till I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior.
I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom.
I whistled on [my] bike. I whistled everywhere.
And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law.
And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music.
And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.
So "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- you know it?
But it can also sound like this.
But during a Christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it's very annoying.
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, "Please stop whistling."
And I just couldn't.
And at one point -- and I had some wine, I have to admit that -- at one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join."
And two weeks later I received a text message: "You're going to America."
So, okay, I'm going to America.
I would love to, but why?
So I immediately called her up, of course.
She Googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course.
She didn't expect me to go there.
And I would have lost my face.
I don't know if that's correct English.
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.
I lost my face.
And she thought, "He will never go there."
But actually I did.
So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast United States, and I entered the world of whistling.
And I also entered the world championship, and I won there in 2004.
That was great fun, of course.
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005, and I won again.
Then I couldn't participate for a few years.
And in 2008 I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.
So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling.
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment.
So I quit my day job as a nurse.
And I try to live my dream -- well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.
Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here.
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?"
Well actually, you are going to whistle along.
And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, "Oh, my God.
Why? Can I go away?"
No, you can't.
Actually it's very simple.
The track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle."
It's about 80 minutes long.
No, no, no. It's four minutes long.
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling.
So I whistle the tone.
Sorry. I forgot one thing.
You whistle the same tone as me.
I heard a wide variety of tones.
This is very promising.
This is very promising.
I'll ask the technicians to start the music.
And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens.
Oh, hah.
I'm so sorry, technicians.
I'm so used to that.
I start it myself.
Okay, here it is.
Okay.
It's easy, isn't it?
Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself.

Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.

<title>Mark Shaw: One very dry demo</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Mark Shaw demos Ultra-Ever Dry, a liquid-repellent coating that acts as an astonishingly powerful shield against water and water-based materials. At the nano level, the spray covers a surface with an umbrella of air so that water bounces right off. Watch for an exciting two-minute kicker.</description>
I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.
You're about to experience a new, available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives.
What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material.
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry, and when you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
So this is a cinder block, uncoated, and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.
Not anymore.
Porous, nonporous.
So what's superhydrophobic?
Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface.
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is, and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees.
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.
But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees, and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.
So as part of the demonstration, what I have is a pair of gloves, and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating, and let's see if you can tell which one, and I'll give you a hint.
Did you guess the one that was dry?
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits.
And we're talking really small here.
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers, and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and to put some scale to that, if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick, and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the width of a human hair.
So very small, but very useful.
And it's not just water that this works with.
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well.
You can see the difference.
Moving onto the next demonstration, we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating, and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle, and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops, and I can't even coax it to leave.
It's that afraid of the water.
So what's going on here? What's happening?
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
And it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air.
It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.
So if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it, and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry.
So what are the applications?
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says, "Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."
The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti-wetting.
We've certainly seen that today.
It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.
It could be anti-corrosion.
No water, no corrosion.
It could be anti-bacterial.
Without water, the bacteria won't survive.
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work.
And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration, but before I do that, I would like to say thank you, and think small.
It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.
Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED?
[Two minutes later...] He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.
It's happening!

<title>Timothy Bartik: The economic case for preschool</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this well-argued talk, Timothy Bartik makes the macro-economic case for preschool education -- and explains why you should be happy to invest in it, even if you don't have kids that age . The economic benefits of well-educated kids, it turns out, go well beyond the altruistic.</description>
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment.
It's a different idea, because usually, when people talk about early childhood programs, they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants, in preschool, they have better K-12 test scores, better adult earnings.
Now that's all very important, but what I want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development.
And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs, we need to interest state governments in this.
The federal government has a lot on its plate, and state governments are going to have to step up.
So we have to appeal to them, the legislators in the state government, and turn to something they understand, that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy.
Now, by promoting economic development, I don't mean anything magical.
All I mean is, is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents.
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development, they don't generally think first about what they're doing about childcare and early childhood programs.
I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.
I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues, a lot of legislators about these issues.
When legislators and others think about economic development, what they first of all think about are business tax incentives, property tax abatements, job creation tax credits, you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.
So for example, states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.
Now, those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions, and the way they can make sense is, by creating more and better jobs, they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.
So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they're paying by paying for these business tax breaks.
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing, create more and better jobs, but in a different way.
It's a somewhat more indirect way.
These programs can promote more and better jobs by, you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool, it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around, and, in turn, that higher-quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community.
Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.
Okay. If you look at the research evidence -- that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment, wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults, you take those known effects, you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out, and you take research on how much skills drive job creation, you will conclude, from these three separate lines of research, that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs, the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and 78 cents, so that's a three-to-one return.
Now you can get much higher returns, of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits, if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state, but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers, and it's the states that are going to have to act.
So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development.
Now, one objection you often hear, or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is, why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children?
What's in it for me?
And the trouble with that objection, it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent.
Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that there are huge spillovers of skills -- that when other people's children get more skills, that actually increases the prosperity of everyone, including people whose skills don't change.
So for example, numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas, it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages; it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically because they're low-cost.
I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.
It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.
They are growing because they have high levels of skills.
So when we invest in other people's children, and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth of a metro area.
As another example, if we look at what determines an individual's wages, and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages, we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part, on that individual's education, for example whether or not they have a college degree.
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition, we find that even once we hold constant, statistically, the effect of your own education, the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages.
So specifically, if you hold constant your education, you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area, you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all.
In fact, this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree, the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects.
So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.
There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area, and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person, but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area, you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.
That's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education.
Now, what's going on here?
What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?
Well, let's think about it this way.
I can be the most skilled person in the world, but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills, my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology, new production techniques.
So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.
They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.
Even if everyone at my firm has good skills, if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills, my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets.
And again, the firm that's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages, and then, particularly in high-tech businesses, they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.
So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm, but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.
So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high-quality, we not only help those children, we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth.
Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out.
So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus, Ohio, but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will, for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and become Wolverines.
And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.
And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.
Well, the reality is, if you look at the data, Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.
That percentage does not vary much from state to state.
It doesn't vary much with the state's economy, whether it's depressed or booming, it doesn't vary much over time.
So the reality is, if you invest in kids, they will stay.
Or at least, enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy.
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way, pay off in higher adult skills.
There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy, and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy, and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar, we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy.
So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling.
So what are the barriers to getting it done?
Well, one obvious barrier is cost.
So if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four, the total annual national cost would be roughly 30 billion dollars.
So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.
On the other hand, if you reflect on that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million, we're talking about an amount of money that amounts to 100 dollars per capita.
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person, is something that any state government can afford to do.
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.
And, of course, as I mentioned, this cost has corresponding benefits.
I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three, 2.78, for the state economy, in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.
And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something, what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid, that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career, just doing the preschool, not improving K-12 or anything else after that, not doing anything with college tuition or access, just directly improving preschool, and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle-class kids.
So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits.
Now, that's one barrier.
I actually think the more profound barrier is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.
So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing the quality of our local workforce, and thereby increasing economic development.
Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds, we're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.
So we're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years, and of course America is notorious for being a short term-oriented society.
Now one response you can make to this, and I sometimes have done this in talks, is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs, there are benefits, parents care about preschool, maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool, and I think those are true, but in some sense they're missing the point.
Ultimately, this is something we're investing in now for the future.
And so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question.
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately not an economic question, it's a moral question: Are we willing, as Americans, are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long-term future of not only our kids, but our community?
Are we still capable of that as a country?
And that's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves.
Is that something that you are still invested in, that you still believe in the notion of investment?
That is the notion of investment.
You sacrifice now for a return later.
So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong.
However, the moral and political choice is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.
Thank you very much.

<title>Tod Machover + Dan Ellsey: Inventing instruments that unlock new music</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Tod Machover of MIT's Media Lab is devoted to extending musical expression to everyone, from virtuosos to amateurs, and in the most diverse forms, from opera to video games. He and composer Dan Ellsey shed light on what's next.</description>
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect -- the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero], that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work.
So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now, we've been engaged in a field called active music.
What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music?
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers -- we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince, orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling, I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra, or into something that nobody has ever heard before.
When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody, people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?
So, we've made a whole series of instruments.
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.
It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments, all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.
So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music, use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound, touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.
And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in, to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.
We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna, where we built a museum around it.
And that led to something which you probably do know.
Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero.
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.
It's very, very important.
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive, but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music, want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works, how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments, like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers, Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm, and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends, who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing -- and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it, you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button, it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.
We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.
So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context, for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called "Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.
If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself, and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.
So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones, you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes, movement to people with Parkinson's disease.
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.
And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.
One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital, so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.
Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it, to experiment with it, to make their own music.
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.
Everybody can experience music in a profound way, we just have to make different tools.
The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you, I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words, more personal things, perhaps deeper things.
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world.
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment, actually into a series of books.
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't.
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument, like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier, but it's actually a robotic music instrument.
So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings, each string is controlled with a little robotic element -- either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings, acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers, and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.
They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.
They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope, not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.
And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.
Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound, and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls, which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared, but the whole physical environment becomes this person.
This is how he's chosen to represent himself.
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.
This is a sneak preview.
This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it, another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces, as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.
So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera.
And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work, to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.
So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan, thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that, because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.
So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?
Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software.
Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan.
So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago, when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic, did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.
He's very shy, too.
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area -- mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.
And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces, but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?
Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face, it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance, with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that, to be able to perform his piece of music.
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller.
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking; in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part, where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?
What's useful to him as an expressive motion?
You know, what's his metaphor for performance?
What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music?
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies -- they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.
And so that's what we'll do today.
TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now?
DE: This is "My Eagle Song."
TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece, completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.
TM: He's really modest, too.
So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.
He can place those exactly where he wants.
Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window, draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore, you can see it also, you can see where the sections are, something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end.
So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says, we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.
It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements, it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.
So, are we ready Adam?
AB: Yeah.
TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.
TM: Bravo.

<title>David Byrne: How architecture helped music evolve</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As his career grew, David Byrne went from playing CBGB to Carnegie Hall. He asks: Does the venue make the music? From outdoor drumming to Wagnerian operas to arena rock, he explores how context has pushed musical innovation.</description>
This is the venue where, as a young man, some of the music that I wrote was first performed.
It was, remarkably, a pretty good sounding room.
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere, it actually sounded pretty good.
This is a song that was recorded there.
This is not Talking Heads, in the picture anyway.
" by Talking Heads) So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood.
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.
The sound system was kind of decent.
And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too, pretty concise.
Other places around the country had similar rooms.
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.
The music was in some ways different, but in structure and form, very much the same.
The clientele behavior was very much the same too.
And so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough -- the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down, shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing.
Since then, I've played other places that are much nicer.
I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that.
And it's been very exciting.
But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written, or was writing at the time, didn't sound all that great in some of those halls.
We managed, but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made.
So I asked myself: Do I write stuff for specific rooms?
Do I have a place, a venue, in mind when I write?
Is that a kind of model for creativity?
Do we all make things with a venue, a context, in mind?
Okay, Africa.
Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa.
And the music there, I would say, the instruments, the intricate rhythms, the way it's played, the setting, the context, it's all perfect. It all works perfect.
The music works perfectly in that setting.
There's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.
The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.
It's no accident.
It's perfect for that particular context.
And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.
It doesn't change key, the notes are long, there's almost no rhythm whatsoever, and the room flatters the music.
It actually improves it.
This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.
It's not as big as a gothic cathedral, so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.
He can, very innovatively, actually change keys without risking huge dissonances.
This is a little bit later.
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.
I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.
They're smaller, even less reverberant, so he can write really frilly music that's very intricate -- and it works.
It fits the room perfectly.
This is La Scala.
It's around the same time, I think it was built around 1776.
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built, they used to yell out to one another.
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage, just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.
If they liked an aria, they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore, not at the end of the show, but immediately.
And well, that was an opera experience.
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.
And the size of the room is not that big.
It's smaller than this.
But Wagner made an innovation.
He wanted a bigger band.
He wanted a little more bombast, so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there.
Okay.
This is Carnegie Hall.
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.
It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.
And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala.
Around the same, according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker, this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage, or gossiping with one another during the show.
They had to be very quiet.
So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls.
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics, which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music.
Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting.
But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall, the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural.
This is Mahler.
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.
That was Bob's last record, yeah.
Popular music, coming along at the same time.
This is a jazz band.
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs.
Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.
There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked.
And they'd say, "Play that part again."
Well, there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.
And a new form of music was born.
These are played mainly in small rooms.
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.
So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that.
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music, whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century, when this became one of the primary venues for music.
And this was one way that the music got there.
Microphones enabled singers, in particular, and musicians and composers, to completely change the kind of music that they were writing.
So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music, but singers, like Frank Sinatra, could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone.
Other singers after him went even further.
This is Chet Baker.
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone.
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.
And he's singing right into your ear.
He's whispering into your ears.
The effect is just electric.
It's like the guy is sitting next to you, whispering who knows what into your ear.
So at this point, music diverged.
There's live music, and there's recorded music.
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.
Now there's venues like this, a discotheque, and there's jukeboxes in bars, where you don't even need to have a band.
There doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever, and the sound systems are good.
People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems.
And, as with jazz, the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others.
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.
The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.
And another new form of music was born.
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful, ended up in what is probably, acoustically, the worst sounding venues on the planet: sports stadiums, basketball arenas and hockey arenas.
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.
They wrote what is now called arena rock, which is medium-speed ballads.
They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for.
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.
It's more a social situation than a musical situation.
And in some ways, the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly.
So there's more new venues.
One of the new ones is the automobile.
I grew up with a radio in a car.
But now that's evolved into something else.
The car is a whole venue.
The music that, I would say, is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it.
It might not be what you want to listen to at home, but it works great in the car -- has a huge frequency spectrum, you know, big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.
Automobile music, you can share with your friends.
There's one other kind of new venue, the private MP3 player.
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.
And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall, or when the audience had to hush up, because you can now hear every single detail.
In other ways, it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet, you turn it up, and the next minute, your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.
So that doesn't really work.
I think pop music, mainly, it's written today, to some extent, is written for these kind of players, for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail, but the dynamic doesn't change that much.
So I asked myself: Okay, is this a model for creation, this adaptation that we do?
And does it happen anywhere else?
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people, birds do it too -- that the birds in the canopy, where the foliage is dense, their calls tend to be high-pitched, short and repetitive.
And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls, so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor.
And birds like this Savannah sparrow, they tend to have a buzzing type call.
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs.
Other birds, like this tanager, have adapted within the same species.
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States, where the forests are a little denser, has one kind of call, and the tananger on the other side, on the west has a different kind of call.
So birds do it too.
And I thought: Well, if this is a model for creation, if we make music, primarily the form at least, to fit these contexts, and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls, and if we write software to fit existing operating systems, is that how it works?
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.
It's adaptive.
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there.
This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view.
The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion, and then somehow it gets shaped into something.
And I'm saying, well, the passion's still there, but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into, that is instinctively and intuitively created first.
We already know where that passion is going.
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.
The writer, Thomas Frank, says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests, that voters, like a lot of us, assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere, that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate, that it's more authentic.
And they'll vote for that.
So that, if somebody can fake sincerity, if they can fake passion, they stand a better chance of being selected in that way, which seems a little dangerous.
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy, are not mutually exclusive.
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds.
We adapt.
We sing.
And like the birds, the joy is still there, even though we have changed what we do to fit the context.
Thank you very much.

<title>Ronny Edry: Israel and Iran: A love story?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When war between Israel and Iran seemed imminent, Israeli graphic designer Ronny Edry shared a poster on Facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message: "Iranians ... we [heart] you." Other Israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message -- and Iranians responded in kind. The simple act of communication inspired surprising Facebook communities like "Israel loves Iran," "Iran loves Israel" and even "Palestine loves Israel."</description>
On March 14, this year, I posted this poster on Facebook.
This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag.
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted.
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other, and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.
And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.
This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now, and we have people, you know, afraid.
It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran.
It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever, for 10 years now.
So at some point it became, you know, to me, I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before.
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook, my friends like it, don't like it, most of the time don't like it, don't share it, don't nothing, and it's another day.
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.
And later on in the night, I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night, and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots, you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.
And I was like, "What's going on?"
So I come to the computer and I start looking on, and suddenly I see many people talking to me, most of them I don't know, and a few of them from Iran, which is -- What?
Because you have to understand, in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.
We don't know people from Iran.
It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from -- it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.
And now people from Iran are talking to me.
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come, because they don't have a computer, she asked her family to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.
So I'm like, whoa.
I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.
People are crying, and she came, she read the text, and she started to cry.
And everybody's crying now.
So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex, as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody what I'd just seen, and people started to see them and to share them, and that's how it started.
The day after, when really it became a lot of talking, I said to myself, and my wife said to me, I also want a poster, so this is her.
Because it's working, put me in a poster now.
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work, but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel who want to say something.
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want, and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.
And that's how it started. And that's how, really, it's unleashed, because suddenly people from Facebook, friends and others, just understand that they can be part of it.
It's not just one dude making one poster, it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures and ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it.
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."
It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.
I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends to come, graphic designers most of them, to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.
It was a huge amount of pictures.
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images, but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it, because I know people: They don't read, they see images.
If it's an image, they may read it.
So here are a few of them.
This one is really moving for me because it's the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning, and now that she sees the posters that we're sending, she starts -- she said that she changed her mind, and now she loves that blue, she loves that star, and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag, and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another, and just a few days after I posted the first poster.
The day after, Iranians started to respond with their own posters.
They have graphic designers. What?
Crazy, crazy.
So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces, but they want to spread the message.
They want to respond. They want to say the same thing.
So. And now it's communication.
It's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message, one to each other.
This never happened before, and this is two people supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war, and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say, "I like this guy. I love those guys."
And it became really big at some point.
And then it became news.
Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.
And suddenly, there is something that was happening they say, "Okay, let's talk about this."
And they just came, and it was so much, I remember one day, Michal, she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him, "Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody."
So she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?
Who is everybody?""Everybody."
They said, "Syria?" "Syria."
"Lebanon?""Lebanon."
At some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today.
It's everybody." The Chinese.
And we were just at the beginning of the story.
Something crazy also happened.
Every time a country started talking about it, like Germany, America, wherever, a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories, so at the beginning we had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.
And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message, to people sending their love, one to each other.
The moment I really understood that something was happening, a friend of mine told me, "Google the word 'Israel.'" And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."
We really changed how people see the Middle East.
Because you're not in the Middle East.
You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East, so you go on Google and you say, "Israel," and they give you the bad stuff.
And for a few days you got those images.
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know, commented on one of the photos.
So for five months now, that's what we are doing, me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.
We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us.
They see images of us, and they see bad images.
So we're working on making good images. End of story.
Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.
This is the enemy.
What?
And it's going both ways.
It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.
And we're understanding. And you show compassion.
And you become friends.
And at some point, you become friends on Facebook, and you become friends in life.
You can go and travel and meet people.
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago.
I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe, I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland, from Germany," of course, and from Israel people came, and we just met there for the first time in real life.
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands, and have a coffee and a nice discussion, and we talk about food and basketball.
And that was the end of it.
Remember that image from the beginning?
At some point we met in real life, and we became friends.
And it goes the other way around.
Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran, lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us, decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel, and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says, "Okay, not that big a deal."
So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher, so we start this new campaign called "Not ready to die in your war."
I mean, it's plus/minus the same message, but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.
And again, something amazing happened, something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."
Just read where those guys are from.
And for every guy from Israel, you've got someone from Iran.
Just people sending their pictures.
Crazy, yes?
So -- So you may ask yourself, who is this dude?
My name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli, I'm a father of two, I'm a husband, and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.
And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but, this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — " I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years, and I know how it looks from the ground.
I know how it can look really bad.
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do, to try to reach the other side before it's too late, because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes, but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.
Maybe as people, because especially in Israel, we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech, and maybe that little thing can change something.
And really, we can be our own ambassadors.
We can just send a message and hope for the best.
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image, because it's all about images.
And maybe that image will help us change something.
Just raise that. Exactly.
And I'm just going to take a picture of it, and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.
Oh my God.
Don't cry.
Thank you guys.

<title>Charles Moore: Seas of plastic</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Capt. Charles Moore of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation first discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- an endless floating waste of plastic trash. Now he's drawing attention to the growing, choking problem of plastic debris in our seas.</description>
Let's talk trash.
You know, we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime.
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.
Mental note to the liberators: throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.
Plastics are also hard to recycle.
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream.
It's diddly-point-squat.
That's the percentage we recycle.
Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge.
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash.
A large, unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea.
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.
In spite of deposit fees, much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes, here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan, who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California.
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET, will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic, polypropylene.
They will float in seawater, but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo.
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific, while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch, while ours litter the Philippines.
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre.
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks.
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach.
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish, like cigarette lighters ...
but, mostly bottle caps.
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface.
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals.
This is Mae West, still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem, so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005 I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.
I got plenty of takers.
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags, they shook my hand.
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton.
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this.
And this.
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this.
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach, the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.
Now, how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton?
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes, from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean, at the base of the food chain, was ingesting these poison pills.
We did hundreds of necropsies, and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long, had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.
Now, you can buy certified organic produce.
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global.
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
We have to throw it away.
Now, the market can do a lot for us, but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.
Narrator : The levels are increasing, the amount of packaging is increasing, the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating, and it's showing up in the ocean.
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source: stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world, he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline, in Long Beach, California.
Charles Moore: Thank you.

<title>Carolyn Steel: How food shapes our cities</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Every day, in a city the size of London, 30 million meals are served. But where does all the food come from? Architect Carolyn Steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city, and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world.</description>
How do you feed a city?
It's one of the great questions of our time.
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were.
And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us.
These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either.
As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals.
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
And it's an escalating problem too.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed.
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land.
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion.
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it.
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
None of it makes very much sense.
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.
So how did we get here?
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent.
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
And it was also fertile.
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.
This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact.
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them.
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough.
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really.
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite.
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world.
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map.
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago.
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move.
Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it.
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from.
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier.
So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle.
And then 10 years later everything changed.
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep.
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
And this changes everything.
To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place.
Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people.
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process.
It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.
Here we have food -- that used to be the center, the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
Now it's anonymous.
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature.
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
So what are we going to do about that?
It's not a new question.
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on.
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway.
And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision.
It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had.
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use.
So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, "sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
I believe we already live in Sitopia.
We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
But anyway, this is -- it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
This is where food should be in our society.
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
By the way, these can be men as well.
It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them.
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's common. It's fresh.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole.
Cows with a view.
Steaming piles of humus.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere.
The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected.
But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city.
And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today?
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
Because I think it's an urgent question.
It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering.
We know we are what we eat.
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
Thank you very much.

<title>Christopher C. Deam: The Airstream, restyled</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this low-key, image-packed talk from 2002, designer Christopher C. Deam talks about his makeover of an American classic: the Airstream travel trailer.</description>
I was asked by Wilsonart International, a plastic laminate company, which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, in 2000.
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look.
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.
So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream.
What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces.
In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and the interiors were completely out of sync with that.
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin.
That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell.
We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in.
The main goal was to smooth out the interior, and begin to speak about motion, and mobility, and independence.
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer.
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.
So that became a challenge.
Compounding that, the material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight, only bends in two dimensions.
It's a compound curve interior.
What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell.
What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell.
And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.
They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin, so they function as an electrical chase.
That's the trailer, pretty much finished.
That trailer led to another commission, to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.
Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.
He said one he would like to make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.
Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.
We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States, that would collect records and go on tours.
This trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people, and basically we'd had a great time with this.
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel, and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.
A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream.
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.
They came to me and said, "Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?"
And I said, "Well, not in that interior."
Anyway, I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype, and it's called the Bambi prototype.
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding."
And I walked in their prototype facility, and it's exactly like my shop, only bigger -- same tools, same things.
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely, so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers, you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.
They didn't want to go to a componentized system.
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.

<title>Elliot Krane: The mystery of chronic pain</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We think of pain as a symptom, but there are cases where the nervous system develops feedback loops and pain becomes a terrifying disease in itself. Starting with the story of a girl whose sprained wrist turned into a nightmare, Elliot Krane talks about the complex mystery of chronic pain, and reviews the facts we're just learning about how it works and how to treat it.</description>
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist, so I put children to sleep for a living.
And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.
But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.
And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease.
Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time.
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation.
But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists.
It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease.
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients.
So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now.
Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this.
Please keep your seat.
A very different feeling.
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather, but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.
In fact, imagine something even worse.
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch.
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler, whom you see in the photograph.
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.
She was 16 years old last year when I met her, and she aspired to be a professional dancer.
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.
Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life.
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story.
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.
You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color.
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that.
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands, to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow, almost all the way to her shoulder.
But the worst part was, not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.
The worst part was that she had allodynia, the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch.
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on -- caused excruciating, burning pain.
How can the nervous system get this so wrong?
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame?
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house.
In your house, wires run in the wall, from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb.
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.
If you hit your thumb with a hammer, these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires, new nerves, take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.
But the situation, of course, in the human body is far more complicated than that.
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion, in fact, what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells.
These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves.
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences.
These glial cells become activated.
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins, which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves, and they start releasing their neurotransmitters, and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth, until what we have is a positive feedback loop.
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch, the toilet flushed three doors down, or your dishwasher went on, or your computer monitor turned off.
That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain.
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.
The nervous system has plasticity.
It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli.
Well, what do we do about that?
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time.
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are, frankly, not very effective for this kind of pain.
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet, and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.
And most importantly, what we do is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life.
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency, despair and depression that always accompanies severe, chronic pain.
It's successful, as you can see from this video of Chandler, who, two months after we first met her, is now doings a back flip.
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here, and she's doing absolutely fantastic.
But the future is actually even brighter.
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem, as we have now, but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells, or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate, that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up, or plasticity, that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain.
So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, "My philosophy: No pain, no pain."
Thank you very much.

<title>Kristina Gjerde: Making law on the high seas</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Kristina Gjerde studies the law of the high seas -- the 64 percent of our ocean that isn't protected by any national law at all. Gorgeous photos show the hidden worlds that Gjerde and other lawyers are working to protect from trawling and trash-dumping, through smart policymaking and a healthy dose of PR.</description>
Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
It's a place of myth and legend.
It's a place marked on ancient maps as "here be monsters."
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.
We are talking about the high seas.
The "high seas" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth.
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it.
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark.
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care.
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue.
To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent.
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore.
For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.
It's unbelievable.
We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all.
And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community.
Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules.
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify.
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas.
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you.
That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling.
And how did we do that?
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process.
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed.
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling.
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm.
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected.
This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection.
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime.
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet.
Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain.
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there.
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.
But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region.
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.
But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food.
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs.
But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection.
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area.
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
It's actually a bay.
It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims.
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.
But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem.
But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region.
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food.
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long.
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.
It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season.
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round.
Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area.
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative.
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present.
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas.
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch.
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative.
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home.
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year.
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October.
So stay tuned for further information.
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found.
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers.
We have the support of governments now behind us.
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots.
At the same time we're saying, "Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."
But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it?
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology.
I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean.
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
But not all the vessels have those to date.
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing.
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas.
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources.
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect.
At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management.
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.
Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide.
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect.
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization.
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.
Thank you.

<title>Bruce Aylward: How we'll stop polio for good</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Polio is almost completely eradicated. But as Bruce Aylward says: Almost isn't good enough with a disease this terrifying. Aylward lays out the plan to continue the scientific miracle that ended polio in most of the world -- and to snuff it out everywhere, forever.</description>
I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea.
Actually, it's a really big idea.
But to get us started, I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world.
Now I bet, in this audience, you're thinking of some really incredible technology, some stuff that I haven't even heard of, I'm absolutely sure.
But I'm also sure, pretty sure, that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.
This is a polio vaccine.
And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted.
This is a great technology.
We can take it completely for granted.
But it wasn't always that way.
Even here in California, if we were to go back just a few years, it was a very different story.
People were terrified of this disease.
They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.
And it was because of scenes like this.
In this scene, people are living in an iron lung.
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before, and then two days later, they can no longer breathe, and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs, but also their breathing muscles.
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually, in this iron lung to breathe for them.
This disease was terrifying.
There was no cure, and there was no vaccine.
The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it.
Twenty years later, they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine.
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s.
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease, and here in the United States it had an incredible impact.
As you can see, the virus stopped, and it stopped very, very fast.
But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world.
And it happened so fast in the United States, however, that even just last month Jon Stewart said this: Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?
Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated.
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.
But the reality is that polio still exists today.
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.
This is the picture.
There's not very much left in the world.
But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership working behind the scenes, almost unknown, I'm sure to most of you here today.
It's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease, and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic.
But just last year, we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio.
And this is the reason: in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade, on opposite sides of the globe, there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.
Hundreds of people were paralyzed.
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults.
And in both cases, we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses, and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.
They had come from thousands of miles away.
And in one case, it originated on another continent.
And not only that, but when they came into these countries, then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia, where, for the first time in over a decade last year, children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years.
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you, these are under control now, and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.
But the message was very clear.
Polio is still a devastating, explosive disease.
It's just happening in another part of the world.
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis.
So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership, is trying to do.
We're not trying to control polio.
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases, because this disease is like a root fire; it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.
So what we're looking for is a permanent solution.
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys, can take for granted a polio-free world.
So we're looking for a permanent solution, and this is where we get lucky.
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
This virus can only survive in people.
It can't live for a very long time in people.
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely.
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth.
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases.
It's been tried six times in the last century, and it's been successful exactly once.
And this is because disease eradication, it's still the venture capital of public health.
The risks are massive, but the pay-off -- economic, humanitarian, motivational -- it's absolutely huge.
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs.
And if we can finish polio eradication, the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone.
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.
But smallpox eradication was hard; it was very, very hard.
And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher, and there's a few reasons for that.
The first is that, when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago, more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox.
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries.
So it was a massive effort.
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine, which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge -- is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash.
So you could get around the disease; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.
With polio it's almost completely different.
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease.
So you can't see the enemy most of the time, and as a result, we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox.
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history.
There's over 10 million people, probably 20 million people, largely volunteers, who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.
These people, these 20 million people, vaccinate over 500 million children every single year, multiple times at the peak of our operation.
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.
It's just two drops, like that.
But reaching 500 million people is much, much tougher.
And these vaccinators, these volunteers, they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest, densest urban slums in the world.
They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.
And they also have to dodge bullets, because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children, even in areas affected by conflict.
One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago -- a place which has eradicated polio, not once, but twice, because they got reinfected.
He was sitting outside of the road, watching one of these polio campaigns unfold, and a few months later he wrote: "This is foreign aid at its most heroic."
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life, all sorts of backgrounds.
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.
This is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years.
They're right at the center of the whole thing.
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years, much longer than it should have -- but once it was built, the results were striking.
Within a couple of years, every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses, with the exception of four countries that you see here.
And in each of those, it was only part of the country.
And then, by 1999, one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept.
And then today, there's been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.
When we started, over 20 years ago, 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus.
Last year, it was 1,000.
And at the same time, the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas.
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example.
It's also tried to save children by doing other things -- giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots, giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns.
But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us, the international community, to reach every single child, every single community, the most vulnerable people in the world, with the most basic of health services, irrespective of geography, poverty, culture and even conflict.
So things were looking very exciting, and then about five years ago, this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.
The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades.
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have.
In conditions like this, the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to.
Now at that time, there was a great, as you can imagine, frustration -- let's call it frustration -- it started to grow very, very quickly.
And all of a sudden, some very important voices in the world of public health started to say, "Hang on.
We should abandon this idea of eradication.
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough."
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds, it's a false premise.
The brutal truth is, if we don't have the will or the skill, or even the money that we need to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world, with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine, then pretty soon, more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year.
There's absolutely no question.
These are children like Umar.
Umar is seven years old, and he's from northern Nigeria.
He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters.
Umar also has polio.
Umar was paralyzed for life.
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004.
This leg, his right leg, now takes an awful beating because he has to half-crawl, because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters, than to get up on his crutches and walk.
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.
As you probably can't see the detail here, but this is his report card, and you'll see, he's got perfect scores.
He got 100 percent in all the important things, like nursery rhymes, for example there.
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days, but it's not true.
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances.
The reality of polio today is something very different.
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world.
It leaves their children paralyzed, and it drags their families deeper into poverty, because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have, trying in vain to find a cure for their children.
We think children deserve better.
And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago, when people were saying, "We should call it off," the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions, new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again.
In northern India, we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this, so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters, so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services.
In northern Nigeria, the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders, they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence.
And now they've even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices, little GIS trackers like this, which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.
And then they can track them, and at the end of the day, they look and see, did these guys get every single street, every single house.
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing.
And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches -- access negotiators.
We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child.
But as we tried these extraordinary things, as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics, we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine, so that when they finally get to these kids, we can have a better bang for our buck.
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry, and within six months, we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted, just two years ago, the last two types of polio in the world.
Now June the ninth, 2009, we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine, and it turned out to be a game-changer.
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had, and we immediately started using this.
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.
And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world.
And we didn't start with the easy places.
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan, because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this.
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days, I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible.
So this morning at about seven o'clock, I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again, so that you could see something that's just unfolding today, which proves that the impossible is possible.
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio.
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month.
Sanitation is terrible, and our old vaccine, you remember, worked half as well as it should have.
And yet, the impossible is happening.
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history, not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.
India's not unique.
In Umar's home country of Nigeria, a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.
And in the last six months, we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history.
Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination of smart people, smart technology and smart investments, polio can now be eradicated anywhere.
We have major challenges, you can imagine, to finish this job, but as you've also seen, it's doable, it has great secondary benefits, and polio eradication is a great buy.
And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus, it's a stark reminder that we are failing, as a society, to reach children with the most basic of services.
And for that reason, polio eradication: it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice.
The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children.
It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm, capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago.
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do, and it's the right thing to do.
Now we're in tough times economically.
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio, "There's never a wrong time to do the right thing."
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do.
And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years.
We have a new vaccine, we have new resolve, and we have new tactics.
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history.
But if we blink now, we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease.
Here's a great idea to spread: End polio now.
Help us tell the story.
Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child, every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever.
Thank you.
Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be?
Where would you say we need to be the smartest?
BA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped -- northern Nigeria, northern India, the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan -- they're going to be the toughest.
But the interesting thing is, of those three, India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly.
It keeps getting reinfected.
So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished.
They're going to be the tough ones.
BG: Now what about the money?
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.
And is it easy to raise that money?
And what's it going to be like the next couple of years?
BA: It's interesting.
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year.
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.
It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.
But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times -- 20, 30 cents to reach a child -- that's not very much money.
But right now we don't have enough of that.
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners, and every time we cut corners, more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.
And that great buy costs us a little bit more.
BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out, and the governments will keep their generosity up.
So good luck. We're all in this with you.
Thank you.

<title>Tony Porter: A call to men</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TEDWomen, Tony Porter makes a call to men everywhere: Don't "act like a man." Telling powerful stories from his own life, he shows how this mentality, drummed into so many men and boys, can lead men to disrespect, mistreat and abuse women and each other. His solution: Break free of the "man box."</description>
I grew up in New York City, between Harlem and the Bronx.
Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating -- no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects.
I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the "man box."
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man.
Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man.
But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood.
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.
They're 11 and 12.
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay.
And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying.
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out.
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her -- he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off.
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?
Hold your head up. Look at me.
Explain to me what's wrong.
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
Why are you crying?"
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, "Just go in your room.
Just go on, go on in your room.
Sit down, get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a --" what?
Like a man.
And he's five years old.
And as I grow in life, I would say to myself, "My God, what's wrong with me?
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"
And I think back.
I think back to my father.
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family.
My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers.
We lived in New York City, as I said.
We lived in the Bronx at the time, and the burial was in a place called Long Island, it was about two hours outside of the city.
And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city.
And the limousine empties out.
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying.
He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.
And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, in the ground -- something I just can't even imagine.
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying.
I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box.
I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, "How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"
Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
No, the boy said to me -- the boy said to me, "It would destroy me."
And I said to myself, "God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?"
It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old.
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.
At this time we're living in the Bronx, and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder, "What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
He was a troubled kid.
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.
He was being raised by his grandmother.
His father wasn't on the set.
His grandmother had two jobs.
He was home alone a lot.
But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man.
He was cool. He was fine.
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
He was having sex.
We all looked up to him.
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
Johnny call, you go.
So I run right upstairs.
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"
Now I immediately knew what he meant.
Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs.
Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy.
Two things: One, I never had sex.
We don't talk about that as men.
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life, the first time you had sex.
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.
There ain't no first time.
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.
Women are objects, especially sexual objects.
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
He told me to go in his room.
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.
She's 16 years old.
She's nude.
She's what I know today to be mentally ill, higher-functioning at times than others.
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.
Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes.
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.
So when I go in the room, I close the door.
Folks, I'm petrified.
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything, and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, "It was good," and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door.
Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught.
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me.
It was way more important to me, about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her.
See collectively, we as men are taught to have less value in women, to view them as property and the objects of men.
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization.
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.
You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it.
So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem.
The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad.
So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.
The world I envision for her -- how do I want men to be acting and behaving?
I need you on board. I need you with me.
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy, I asked a nine-year-old boy, "What would life be like for you, if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"
He said to me, "I would be free."
Thank you folks.

<title>Stanley McChrystal: Listen, learn ... then lead</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Four-star general Stanley McChrystal shares what he learned about leadership over his decades in the military. How can you build a sense of shared purpose among people of many ages and skill sets? By listening and learning -- and addressing the possibility of failure.</description>
Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning, I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before.
We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early.
You do some routine refresher training, and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.
And you put on the T-10 parachute.
And you're very careful how you put the straps, particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.
And then a jumpmaster comes, and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.
He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed, your shoulders are crushed down, and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while, because this is the Army.
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on, and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people, and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.
And you wait a little bit longer, because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.
Then you take off.
And it's painful enough now -- and I think it's designed this way -- it's painful enough so you want to jump.
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along, and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.
You sit there, OK.
Then they give you 10 minutes.
And of course, you're responding with all of these.
And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.
Then they give you, "Get ready."
Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.
And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?
I'm probably going to jump.
There's no way to get out of this at this point."
You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.
And this was that Tuesday morning in September, and it was pretty nice outside.
So nice air comes flowing in.
The jumpmasters start to check the door.
And then when it's time to go, a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go."
The first guy goes, and you're just in line, and you just kind of lumber to the door.
Jump is a misnomer; you fall.
You fall outside the door, you're caught in the slipstream.
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position -- head down in your chest, your arms extended, put over your reserve parachute.
You do that because, 27 years before, an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open.
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute -- you've got a whole new problem set.
But typically you do; typically it opens.
And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right, at that point you get another little thrill.
Boom.
So then you look around, you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good."
Now you prepare for the inevitable.
You are going to hit the ground.
You can't delay that much.
And you really can't decide where you hit very much, because they pretend you can steer, but you're being delivered.
So you look around, where you're going to land, you try to make yourself ready.
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line, so that it's not on you when you land, and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet, your calves, your thighs, your buttocks and your push-up muscles.
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll.
And that's not going to hurt.
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.
And as soon as I hit, the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.
I'd shake my head, and I'd ask myself the eternal question: "Why didn't I go into banking?"
And I'd look around, and then I'd see another paratrooper, a young guy or girl, and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment.
They'd be doing everything that we had taught them.
And I realized that, if they had to go into combat, they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.
And I realized that, if they came out of combat, it would be because we led them well.
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump, but it's not any jump -- that was September 11th, 2001.
And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.
When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.
And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very, very real -- and leadership seemed important.
But things had changed; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.
I'd been successful, but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes, and on that morning, I didn't know it.
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership: Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership.
This was my father in Vietnam.
And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful; they didn't lie, cheat, steal or abandon their comrades.
And I still believe real leaders are like that.
But in my first 25 years of career, I had a bunch of different experiences.
One of my first battalion commanders, I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march, and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.
And I'm not sure that was real interaction.
But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander, I went out to the National Training Center.
And we did an operation, and my company did a dawn attack -- you know, the classic dawn attack: you prepare all night, move to the line of departure.
And I had an armored organization at that point.
We move forward, and we get wiped out -- I mean, wiped out immediately.
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.
And after the battle, they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review" to teach you what you've done wrong.
Sort of leadership by humiliation.
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything: "and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc."
I walked out feeling as low And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.
And I went up to apologize to him, and he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great."
And in one sentence, he lifted me, put me back on my feet, and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure.
When 9/11 came, 46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.
First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with: the environment changed -- the speed, the scrutiny, the sensitivity of everything now is so fast, sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it.
But everything we do is in a different context.
More importantly, the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries.
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them, I'm now leading a force that's dispersed, and I've got to use other techniques.
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat, I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls -- I've got to use everything I can, not just for communication, but for leadership.
A 22-year-old individual operating alone, thousands of miles from me, has got to communicate to me with confidence.
I have to have trust in them and vice versa.
And I also have to build their faith.
And that's a new kind of leadership for me.
We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.
An emerging opportunity came -- didn't have time to get everybody together.
So we had to get complex intelligence together, we had to line up the ability to act.
It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command, convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium.
We failed.
The mission didn't work.
And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force, rebuild their confidence -- me and them, and them and me, and our seniors and us as a force -- all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.
Entirely new requirement.
Also, the people had changed.
You probably think that the force that I led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons.
In reality, much of the force I led looked exactly like you.
It was men, women, young, old -- not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.
And so instead of giving orders, you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose.
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference, the ages, had changed so much.
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan, and on that operation, a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team.
We talked about the operation, and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"
And one young Ranger in the back -- his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind -- he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade."
And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness, and yet he has different experiences, in many cases a different vocabulary, a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders.
And yet, we need to have that shared sense.
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise, because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot, that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore.
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing?
And it's a brand new leadership challenge.
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent, a lot more willing to listen, a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.
And yet, again, you're not all in one room.
Then another thing.
There's an effect on you and on your leaders.
There's an impact, it's cumulative.
You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces.
And I remembered his son was in our force.
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."
I said, "Where is he now?"
And he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight."
Think about watching your brother, father, daughter, son, wife in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it.
Think about knowing that over time.
And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.
And you have to watch and take care of each other.
I probably learned the most about relationships.
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together.
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.
And every morning in the Ranger regiment, every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a six-stanza Ranger creed.
You may know one line of it, it says, "I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy."
And it's not a mindless mantra, and it's not a poem.
It's a promise.
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger, "No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me, if you need me, I'm coming."
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger.
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing.
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever.
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007, and an old friend of mine, that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note, just in an envelope, that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot, that you would come, if alive."
And having that kind of relationship, for me, turned out to be critical at many points in my career.
And I learned that you have to give that in this environment, because it's tough.
That was my journey.
I hope it's not over.
I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right; they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.
This isn't easy stuff.
It's not like that electronic abs machine where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.
And it isn't always fair.
You can get knocked down, and it hurts and it leaves scars.
But if you're a leader, the people you've counted on will help you up.
And if you're a leader, the people who count on you need you on your feet.
Thank you.

<title>Arunachalam Muruganantham: How I started a sanitary napkin revolution!</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When he realized his wife had to choose between buying family meals and buying her monthly "supplies," Arunachalam Muruganantham vowed to help her solve the problem of the sanitary pad. His research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model. </description>
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
It makes me to stand here, the fame, the money I got out of it.
So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
What you did in the early marriage days, you tried to impress your wife. I did the same.
On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.
I saw. "What is that?" I asked.
My wife replied, "None of your business."
Then, being her husband, I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days.
Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.
Then I was shocked. What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
And it's called affordability.
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.
Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?
The very first time, at the age of 29, that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it?
It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?
Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
"Close your eyes. Whatever I give, it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring, even a chocolate, I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.
Close your eyes."
Because I tried to make it intimate.
Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
Then other victims, they got into my sisters.
But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
Why I am not getting [any]?
You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
They also refused. Finally, I decide, use sanitary pad myself.
Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon.
Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest, like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe.
I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle, I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties, while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press, doses of blood will go there.
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget -- the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.
My God, it's unbelievable.
But here the problem is, one company is making napkin out of cotton. It is working well.
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
You need first funds.
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.
Why is this? I used medical college girls.
She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls.
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material. Again, a stop-up.
Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant, anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
That is my invention.
So after that, what I did, usually if anyone got a patent or an invention, immediately you want to make, convert into this.
I never did this. I dropped it just like this, because you do this, if anyone runs after money, their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating.
Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth, a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
It is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.
So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries.
Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
Play video one.
Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"
She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups.
That is my idea.
AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment for machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.
They are performing puja.
: You just think, competing giants, even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
I'm sustaining on seventh year.
Already 600 installations. What is my mission?
I'm going to make India [into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create.
That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
I'm doing something serious.
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.
Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.
That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad.
I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.
I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe. That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software.
Now 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?
So I classify the people into three: uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
Little educated, done this. Surplus educated, what are you going to do for the society?
Thank you very much. Bye!

<title>Amanda Bennett: We need a heroic narrative for death</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days, too. Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why, for the loved ones of the dying, having hope for a happy ending shouldn't warrant a diagnosis of "denial." She calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life.</description>
So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China, the night I met my husband.
It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking.
So I went to a party.
I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie, and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar, there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations.
What a gift it was to the eager, young foreign correspondent that I was then.
I'd pump him for information, I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write.
I talk to him for hours.
Only months later, I discover who he really was.
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.
"I don't understand. Soybeans?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."
"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?"
I said, "You jerk."
Only jerk wasn't the word I used.
I said, "You could've gotten me fired."
And he said, "Let's get married."
"Travel the world and have lots of kids."
So we did.
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be.
He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.
He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids.
We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do.
So when we found the cancer, it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other, we believed that, if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough, and we worked hard enough, we could keep him from dying ever.
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.
The surgeon emerged from the surgery.
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: "We got it all."
Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely.
It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type, with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most.
And yet, he did not die.
Mysteriously, he lived on.
He coached Little League for our son.
He built a playhouse for our daughter.
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists.
I'm looking for a cure.
So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months.
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on.
Then another year goes by.
Two years go by.
More specialists.
We take the kids to Italy.
We take the kids to Australia.
And then more years pass, and the cancer begins to grow.
This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.
They're exotic. They're experimental.
They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.
So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.
The cancer begins to shrink, and for the third time, we've dodged death.
So now I ask you, how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night, sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?
This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying, perhaps tonight.
So what do I say when he says, "What do you want me to do?"
There's another drug out there.
It's newer. It's more powerful.
He started it just two weeks ago.
Perhaps there's still hope ahead.
So what do I say?
I say, "Keep him alive if you can."
And Terence died six days later.
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.
It was an exhilarating fight, and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation.
We fought together, we lived together.
It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious.
It was also an expensive fight.
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.
And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: "Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."
We never got the chance to say goodbye.
We never thought it was the end.
We always had hope.
So what do we make of all of this?
Being a journalist, after Terence died, I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.
And what did I discover?
Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.
Yet I had that piece of paper.
We both did.
And they were readily available.
I had them right at hand.
Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope.
I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.
Yet we never got to no further hope.
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope.
I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way.
Right up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally, that I could keep him from dying ever.
Now, what do the experts call this?
They say it's denial.
It's a strong word, isn't it?
Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through.
And I hear the medical professionals say, "Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial.
The family won't listen to reason.
They're in denial.
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."
Now, I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking.
It's not just families either.
The medical professionals too, you out there, you're in denial too.
You want to help. You want to fix.
You want to do.
You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.
I saw it firsthand.
Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, "Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."
Days before he died.
Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, "You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."
So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope," and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design.
You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human.
It's not a bug.
It's a feature.
So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion.
It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it.
Maybe I wanted to believe it.
And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too.
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt, it felt like giving up -- meant giving up not only his life but also our story, our story of us as fighters, the story of us as invincible, and for the doctors, the story of themselves as healers.
So what do we need?
Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.
Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.
People did mention hospice, but I wouldn't listen.
Hospice was for people who were dying, and Terence wasn't dying.
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.
We have a noble path to curing the disease, patients and doctors alike, but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying.
Dying is seen as failing, and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.
Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets.
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.
This is a poem about Mark Antony.
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy?
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.
And he's been a pretty good general.
He's won all the fights, he's eluded all the people that are out to get him, and yet this time, finally, he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost.
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.
They're singing.
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.
And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods, and it's time to let go.
And the poet tells him what to do.
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero.
"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing."
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.
And isn't that what we're missing?
How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial.
It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system -- doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope.
Hope isn't a bug.
It's a feature.
Thank you.

<title>Eleni Gabre-Madhin: A commodities exchange for Ethiopia</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Economist Eleni Gabre-Madhin outlines her ambitious vision to found the first commodities market in Ethiopia. Her plan would create wealth, minimize risk for farmers and turn the world's largest recipient of food aid into a regional food basket.</description>
You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains, far from these beautiful mountains, where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different, which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product.
And why not?
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few, but a fundamental human right for all.
And what is happiness?
Happiness is the freedom of choice.
The freedom to chose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how.
Where does choice come from?
And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
Well, one way to express choice is through the market.
Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately, the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.
The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market.
In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth, Ethiopia.
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food.
That was a turning point for my life.
Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.
And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated, compared to 40 percent in Asia.
African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, compared to 144 in Asia.
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America, and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice, and therefore without much freedom.
His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty.
He comes to the market when prices are lowest, with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest, because he has no choice.
She comes back to the market some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice.
The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists?
Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz, in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient, but poor.
Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else.
Well, we don't need, now, any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.
And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business.
And that business is agriculture.
Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.
This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather inefficiently -- and let the private market do its magic.
Well, what happened over the last 25 years?
Did Africa feed itself?
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?
I think we're all in this room, probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years, where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago, where food production per capita has stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.
So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?
The market reforms prompted by the West -- and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders -- trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water.
Like its agriculture, Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.
We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market, and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets, are extremely high.
In fact, only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market.
Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as market information, grades and standards, and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles, in narrow networks of people they know and trust.
And because of that, as grain changes hands -- and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -- every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa -- it also changes sacks.
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality.
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals, and situations where there are deficits, for example.
It also has very high cost implications.
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence of grades and standards and market information, sacks have to be constantly changed.
And this leads to very high handling costs.
For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa, come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind -- trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce, and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market, the nearest local market they know -- where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.
Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.
In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.
In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear.
And in my view, there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face.
In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.
This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers, but also direct implications for food security.
To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002, Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.
That in turn, because of the weak marketing system, led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.
And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002.
Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis, to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.
What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.
This is a tragic example of arrested development, or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia, but happens over and over, all over Africa.
Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.
I am here to tell you that change is in the air.
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions, or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.
Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly, that markets don't happen by themselves.
In the 1980s, it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right.
There was a very influential book about that, which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.
When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else.
Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia, after nearly 30 years abroad.
I did so for a simple reason.
After having spent more than a decade understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets, I decided it was time to do something about it.
I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.
Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept, is not new to the world.
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.
That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade, which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found, or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan, rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done.
From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market, which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances, and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture, and the rise of Chicago to a global market, agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.
Now, over the last century, we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries, and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa -- products produced mainly in the south -- are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.
But that is actually changing.
And we're seeing a shift -- powered mainly because of information technology -- a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.
Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example, where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year.
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology, aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago, 2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world.
Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities, Ethiopia's small farmers.
So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
We're creating a system that serves all market actors, that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia, we've done something rather unique, which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective, or what we call the ECX Edge.
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself.
And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work.
You've got one donor trying to develop market information, another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards, another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.
In our approach in Ethiopia, we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem, or environment, in which trade takes place.
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system, which will initially start as an open outcry, because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.
But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas.
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually, without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things, simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.
At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country, in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.
And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system, to assure that payment is done appropriately, in the right amount and at the right time, so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
Obviously, we work with exchange actors, and as we're developing the exchange market itself, we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework, the overarching legal framework for making this market work.
So, in fact, our proclamation is going to parliament next month.
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country, using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers.
What this does is transforms, fundamentally, the farmers' relationship to the market.
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market, eight to 10 kilometers away on average, and sell whatever they happened to have, without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
And they start to think national, and even global.
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions, but also planting decisions, on the basis of information coming from the futures price market.
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium.
So all of this will transform farmers.
It will also transform the way traders do business.
It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
Can Ethiopia do this?
It seems very ambitious.
But it will create new opportunities.
We believe that this initiative requires great political will, and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector, and really even the underlying legal framework.
We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium, which starts in about eight months.
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today.
We believe that the stakes are high, but that the returns will be even greater.
ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market in agricultural commodities.
Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
And we feel that over the next five years, if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market, and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa's grain production, and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.
So the potential is there.
The will is there.
The commitment is there.
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture, and to change Africa.
So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.
Thank you very much.

<title>Carl Honoré: In praise of slowness</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Journalist Carl Honore believes the Western world's emphasis on speed erodes health, productivity and quality of life. But there's a backlash brewing, as everyday people start putting the brakes on their all-too-modern lives.</description>
What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.
I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city, studio to studio, interview to interview, serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.
Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...
so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.
And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?
Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward.
A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time.
Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock.
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again -- "These days even instant gratification takes too long."
And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?
No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.
We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.
And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.
And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too.
So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to, you know, salute the sun, but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at.
But there's a very serious point, and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life, we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us.
We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives -- on our health, our diet, our work, our relationships, the environment and our community.
And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life.
And I think for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness.
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, "I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time, or the patience, or the tranquility, to be with the other person, to listen to them.
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know, I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."
I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here, paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page, and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, when a dad sits down to read to his son, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness.
And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people.
And one of them made reference to a series of books called "The One-Minute Bedtime Story."
And I wince saying those words now, but my first reaction at the time was very different.
My first reflex was to say, "Hallelujah -- what a great idea!
This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."
But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, "Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"
And I put away the newspaper -- and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there, and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.
I just thought, and I thought long and hard.
And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.
And I had two questions in my head.
The first was, how did we get so fast?
And the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down?
Now, if you think about how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.
You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology.
But I think if you cut through those forces, you get to what might be the deeper driver, the nub of the question, which is how we think about time itself.
In other cultures, time is cyclical.
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles.
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.
Whereas in the West, time is linear.
It's a finite resource; it's always draining away.
You either use it, or lose it.
"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.
And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation.
Time is scarce, so what do we do?
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?
We try and do more and more with less and less time.
We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line -- a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach, but a finish line nonetheless.
And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset?
And thankfully, the answer is yes, because what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.
Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable: they're slowing down, and finding that, although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill, the opposite turns out to be true: that by slowing down at the right moments, people find that they do everything better.
They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better; they work better; they live better.
And, in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration, lie what a lot of people now refer to as the "International Slow Movement."
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries.
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.
I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable.
They want to get back to slower rhythms.
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, but has spread right across Europe and beyond.
And in this, towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape, so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another.
So they might curb traffic, or put in a park bench, or some green space.
And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts, because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City, it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.
It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town, that we believe that in the 21st century, slowness has a role to play.
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine.
And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine, which tend to tap into sort of slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.
Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.
But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, clearly have some kind of benefit.
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work, and what we might learn from them.
Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there.
I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford, and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine, a men's magazine, and it said on the front, "How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."
So, you know, even sex is on a stopwatch these days.
Now, you know, I like a quickie as much as the next person, but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper, sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents, and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they, when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."
Now, we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric, but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops, or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex.
And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure -- they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.
The workplace.
Right across much of the world -- North America being a notable exception -- working hours have been coming down.
And Europe is an example of that, and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less, and also that their hourly productivity goes up.
Now, clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France -- too much, too soon, too rigid.
But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries, are showing that it's possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic.
And Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth, and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy.
And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought.
It's not just, though, these days, adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework, more tutoring, more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.
And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me to write to their parents, to help them slow down, to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill.
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more.
So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13, and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said, "What are you -- you know, our kids will fall" -- the headmaster said, "No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."
And just this last month, the exam results came in, and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent on average last year.
And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much, are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars, to the point that would make your eyes water.
But they lack spark; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside -- they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools, and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.
And in Harvard, for instance, they send out a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen -- telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard, if they put on the brakes, if they do less, but give time to things, the time that things need, to enjoy them, to savor them.
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.
And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think -- "Slow Down!" -- with an exclamation mark on the end.
So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: that less is very often more, that slower is very often better. But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it?
I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness, and that's true, but that's not all of it.
I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time.
And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.
And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway, you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.
But why is it so hard to slow down?
I think there are various reasons.
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.
It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions.
We fill our head with distraction, with busyness, so that we don't have to ask, am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.
It's a byword for "lazy," "slacker," for being somebody who gives up.
You know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous with being stupid.
I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as "bad slow."
You know, I got stuck on the M25, which is a ring road around London, recently, and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you, that's really bad slow.
But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.
And good slow is, you know, taking the time to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work.
Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life.
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it.
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world -- you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations.
Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.
Another encouraging sign, I think, is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status -- China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on -- these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, many people in them, and there's a debate going on in their media, on the streets.
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, "Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that."
So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible?
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down? And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes.
And I present myself as Exhibit A, a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic.
I still love speed. You know, I live in London, and I work as a journalist, and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness, and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.
I play squash and ice hockey, two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.
But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise.
And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously.
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic.
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before.
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier, healthier, more productive than I ever have.
I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it.
And perhaps, the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper, richer, stronger.
And for me, I guess, the litmus test for whether this would work, and what it would mean, was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, and I just slow down to his pace and we read.
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock, they don't do quality time, where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.
They need you to move at their rhythm.
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, "You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded, because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.
It's become my reward at the end of the day, something I really cherish.
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon, which goes a little bit like this: a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on another book tour, and I had my bags packed.
I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi, and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.
He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together, and put a sticker of his favorite character, Tintin, on the front.
And he said to me, or he handed this to me, and I read it, and it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin."
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.
Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"
And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card for being the best story reader in the world."
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."
Thank you very much.

<title>Amy Lockwood: Selling condoms in the Congo</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: HIV is a serious problem in the DR Congo, and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms. But few people are using them. Why? "Reformed marketer" Amy Lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy. </description>
I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development.
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the [second] largest country in Africa.
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.
The DRC is a dangerous place.
In the past 10 years, five million people have died due to a war in the east.
But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC.
There are many health issues as well.
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults.
This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected.
And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.
Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost.
And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien.
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay.
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.
Now Damien knows all about condoms, but he doesn't sell them.
He said there's just not in demand.
It's not surprising, because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms.
Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions.
They like the generics.
And as a marketer, I found that curious.
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity.
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live" or Trust.
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently.
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom.
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom?
Sex!
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this.
Their marketing is slightly different.
The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is.
Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing: understanding who's the audience.
And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].
It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these.
But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples, the young women, the young men -- whose lives depend on it.
And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.
It might just save their lives.
Thank you.

<title>Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Cambridge researcher Aubrey de Grey argues that aging is merely a disease -- and a curable one at that. Humans age in seven basic ways, he says, all of which can be averted.</description>
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work.
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging.
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it.
I'm going to do that in two steps.
The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place.
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension.
So I'm going to start with why we should.
Now, I want to ask a question.
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?
That was easy. OK.
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
And here is that characteristic.
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago.
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.
It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end, because the majority of the British public, and certainly the majority of members of Parliament, came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.
What part of this do people not understand?
It's not just about life, of course -- -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
It's a global trance.
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging.
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless.
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.
But the question is, are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is?
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say.
Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
People worry about overpopulation; they say, "Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people."
And that's true.
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this.
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate.
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.
If we vacillate, hesitate, and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be, because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could -- we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span, and I consider that that is immoral.
That's my answer to the overpopulation question.
Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all.
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem.
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard.
So that's all I'm going to say about that.
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.
A very simple definition.
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism.
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement.
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us, despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms, because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects.
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon.
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure.
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet.
We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention.
So then, what do we do about that?
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?
But it isn't.
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two.
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live?
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple.
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer."
That's the wrong answer.
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose.
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames.
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.
We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later.
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics -- you know, the same sort of time frame.
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all.
That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp.
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
This is a very important point for me to get across.
Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
I decided to give this a little name, which is "longevity escape velocity."
Well, it seems to get the point across.
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live, in terms of remaining life expectancy, as measured by their health, for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
You won't be able to withstand them.
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense, in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental, and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies.
But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes -- is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
And that's quite a thought.
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk, my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one; namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity?
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
And this is what it is.
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average.
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday.
So, in other words, we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies.
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice?
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer.
One has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.
I say that's nonsense.
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities.
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
15 years from the robust mouse.
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.
So they'll probably think it's five years away.
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications.
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
I'm going to use this word "damage" to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology.
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.
But it is not part of metabolism itself.
And this turns out to be useful.
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage.
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment.
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology.
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
We can call it the "engineering approach," and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
It does not intervene in this process or this one.
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle, and it's something that we are within range of being able to do, because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.
The engineering approach simply says, "Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot, so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."
We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another.
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
The list on the right is also incomplete.
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list.
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology.
And there are only seven of them.
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
Of course one can make a biological argument.
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.
What can damage accumulate in?
The answer is: long-lived molecules, because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.
It's got to be long-lived molecules.
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all, in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it.
We do need to really start trying.
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience, and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.
I've published a great deal on this; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based, and there's quite a lot of detail there.
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.
So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously.
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.
And we'll just end with a few things.
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."
And you know what happened.
So, you know, this does happen.
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate, and to do what you think is going to work, and you get money for it if you win.
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
This is what's going to take a bit of money.
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?
Not very long. OK.
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech, but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance.
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?
AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question, which I happen to agree with, which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution; [aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging; you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly, and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals, living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species.
CA: The genes don't care but we do?
AG: That's right.
Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years, the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.
If I project that, that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?
AG: If you lose a bit of weight.
Your numbers are a bit out.
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade.
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo, and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.
If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years, as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?
AG: There are technical implications certainly.
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate, especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway, because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification.
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells.

<title>Lewis Pugh: My mind-shifting Everest swim</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: After he swam the North Pole, Lewis Pugh vowed never to take another cold-water dip. Then he heard of Lake Imja in the Himalayas, created by recent glacial melting, and Lake Pumori, a body of water at an altitude of 5300 m on Everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change.</description>
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole.
And while that swim took place three years ago, I can remember it as if it was yesterday.
I remember standing on the edge of the ice, about to dive into the water, and thinking to myself, I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening.
The water is completely black.
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade, or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's flipping freezing in that water.
And then a thought came across my mind: if things go pear-shaped on this swim, how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean?
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible.
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy, and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water.
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days.
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst.
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following: I'm never, ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again.
Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change.
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier.
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake.
And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great, big battleground on this earth.
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas.
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is, and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much, I think we have a real risk of instability.
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, all these countries.
And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest, the highest mountain on this earth, and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest.
Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest, but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.
28 great, big, powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don't just have my Speedo, but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world.
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude.
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
So it's right up in the heavens.
It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time.
That's not the worst part of it.
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.
Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest, and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain.
And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you're trying to do that, and then the bodies are coming past you, it humbles you, and you also realize very, very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are.
And we walked up this pathway, all the way up.
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier.
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice.
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest, and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself, for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music, I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water.
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters, and then I realized very, very quickly, I had a huge problem on my hands.
I could barely breathe.
I was gasping for air.
I then began to choke, and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.
And it all happened so quickly: I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.
And luckily, the water was quite shallow, and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air.
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.
I carried on for another five or six strokes, and then I had nothing in my body, and I went down to the bottom of the lake.
And I don't where I got it from, but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake.
I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have.
I have never, ever heard such utter bollocks.
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have.
I got myself to the side of the lake.
My crew grabbed me, and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp.
And there, we sat down, and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest.
And my team just gave it to me straight.
They said, Lewis, you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim.
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming, you must forget.
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army, about speed and aggression, you put that to one side.
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.
Take some time to rest and think about things.
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time, and instead of swimming fast, swim as slowly as possible.
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.
And remember, never ever swim with aggression.
This is the time to swim with real humility.
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later.
And I stood there on the edge of the lake, and I looked up at Mt. Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself, just do this slowly.
And I swam across the lake.
And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side.
But I learned two very, very important lessons there on Mt. Everest, and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well, doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.
And similarly, now, before I do anything, I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task.
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is, frankly, the Mt. Everest of all problems -- just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long, just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long, doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on.
The warning signs are all there.
When I was born, the world's population was 3.5 billion people.
We're now 6.8 billion people, and we're expected to be 9 billion people by 2050.
And then the second lesson, the radical, tactical shift.
And I've come here to ask you today: what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment, which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world, and most importantly, in a sustainable world?
And I ask you, please, to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make, which will make that big difference, and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it, and commit a hundred percent, because very, very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it.
So thank you very, very much.

<title>John Hodgman: Design, explained.</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: John Hodgman, comedian and resident expert, "explains" the design of three iconic modern objects. </description>
Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design, and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.
But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs, so I pretty much know everything there is.
Now, I'm sure you recognize this object; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days.
This is known as the Theme Building; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky.
And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.
It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era, when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants.
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking.
When it was uncovered, it ushered in a new era of streamlined, archaically futuristic design called Googie, which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age, a misnomer.
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often, preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls.
Ah yes, a table.
We use these every day.
And on top of it, the juicy salif.
This is a design by Philippe Starck, who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.
And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision, its playfulness, its innovation and its promise of imminent violence.
It is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it.
It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time, which would be useful out in the lobby, I would say.
And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism, it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts.
It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that, you never see it as anything else again.
It is also not a monument to design, it is a monument to design's utility.
You can take it home with you, unlike the Theme Building, which will stay where it is forever.
This is affordable and can come home with you and, as such, it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can't go in your drawers; trust me, I found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design.
One other thing about it, if you do have one at home, let me tell you one of the features you may not know: when you fall asleep, it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep.
Okay, what is this object?
I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.
It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate?
I don't get it.
Does anyone know? Chi?
It's an ... iPhone. iPhone.
Oh yes, that's right, I remember those; I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days.
No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.
Here is my well-loved iPhone.
I do so many things on this little device.
I like to read books on it.
More than that, I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect.
I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox, for example.
Every now and then, I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally.
And yet I forget about it all the time.
This is a design that once you saw it, you forgot about it.
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life.
Unlike the Theme Building, this is not alien technology.
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.
And unlike the juicy salif, it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain, rather, it simply attaches itself to your brain.
And you didn't even notice it happened.
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman.
I just explained design.
Thank you very much.

<title>Lakshmi Pratury: The lost art of letter-writing</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Lakshmi Pratury remembers the lost art of letter-writing and shares a series of notes her father wrote to her before he died. Her short but heartfelt talk may inspire you to set pen to paper, too.</description>
So I thought, "I will talk about death."
Seemed to be the passion today.
Actually, it's not about death.
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
That's what I want to talk about.
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.
Handwriting is a disappearing art.
I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new?
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug.
But too late.
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter.
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.
So what do I plan to leave for my son?
I collect autograph books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy.
I plan to publish my own notebook.
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son.
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation.
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
I took it out for the first time to come here.
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up.
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me.
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again."
Thank you.

<title>Andrew Blum: Discover the physical side of the internet</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When a squirrel chewed through a cable and knocked him offline, journalist Andrew Blum started wondering what the Internet was really made of. So he set out to go see it -- the underwater cables, secret switches and other physical bits that make up the net.</description>
I've always written primarily about architecture, about buildings, and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions.
An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place, or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places, at the end of the day, you can go and you can visit them. You can walk around them.
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.
You can experience their sense of place.
But what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was I going out into the world, and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.
And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone, I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day, but I was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.
And what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed.
In this very short period of time, you know, whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last, you know, four or five years of being online all the time, our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided. You know, we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking out in the world around us.
And what was even more striking to me, and what I really got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own.
If you went and looked for images of the Internet, this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.
It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth, the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest, I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.
We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.
So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them together in the same place.
And then this happened.
My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does, and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch, and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard, and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire, and he said, "There's your problem.
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."
And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
It was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on.
But that in fact seemed to be the case.
A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet.
And then I got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it. Where would it go?
Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?
Could I go there? Who would I meet?
You know, was there something actually out there?
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.
This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it, as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben, because that's where you get the best reception, but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while, and she looks at it and she says, "This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for.
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it.
It wasn't a real world out there.
But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there, and that's what I spent about two years visiting, these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit, and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York, which is one of the buildings in the world, one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings, where more networks of the Internet connect to each other than anywhere else.
And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.
It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is, connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network, and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.
A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others, has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings.
There's a very short list of these places.
And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home to about a half a dozen very important networks, which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.
And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.
If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath the ocean, cables like this.
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive, as expansive as you can imagine.
They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five or eight thousand miles in length, and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other, and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood, and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams, but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.
And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.
And then they connect to the continent somewhere.
They connect in a manhole like this. Literally, this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago, when I started thinking about this, there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa, represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.
Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable, they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build an industry around it, they need to know that their connection isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks, you have to send a ship out into the water, throw a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end, and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.
It's an intensely, intensely physical process.
So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently worked for Tata Communications, the communications wing of Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.
And I've never met him. We've only communicated via this telepresence system, which always makes me think of him as the man inside the Internet.
And he is English. The undersea cable industry is dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.
Because they all started at the same time with the boom about 20 years ago.
And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces onto them, until they had built a belt around the world, which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.
They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world, and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around the other direction. And then having done that, they started to look for places to wire next.
They looked for the unwired places, and that's meant North and South, primarily these cables to Africa.
But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.
He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.
And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection, these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.
It seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.
And Simon was working on a new cable, WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa, to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.
And he said there was coming soon, depending on the weather, but he'd let me know when, and so with about four days notice, he said to go to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9, this guy will walk out of the water.
And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line, called a messenger line, and that was the first link between sea and land, this link that would then be leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place.
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off, and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out to the ship, and when he got there, they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie, and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore, and then he lit a cigarette.
And then once that cable was on shore, they began to prepare to connect it to the other side, for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.
And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a -- sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down, and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.
And what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.
You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer giving directions in the background. And more importantly, the places are the same. These cables still connect these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa, Mumbai, Singapore, New York.
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days, and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover back on top, and they push the sand over that, and we all forget about it.
And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud, but every time we put something on the cloud, we give up some responsibility for it.
We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.
And that doesn't seem right.
There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires.
And we should know, I think, we should know where our Internet comes from, and we should know what it is that physically, physically connects us all.
Thank you.
Thanks.

<title>Dayananda Saraswati: The profound journey of compassion</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Swami Dayananda Saraswati unravels the parallel paths of personal development and attaining true compassion. He walks us through each step of self-realization, from helpless infancy to the fearless act of caring for others.</description>
A human child is born, and for quite a long time is a consumer.
It cannot be consciously a contributor.
It is helpless.
It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.
It has to totally surrender, as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.
It has to totally surrender.
That implies a lot of trust.
That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust.
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust.
It doesn't know even the word "violation."
Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame.
As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor.
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure, one feels big, one feels: I have enough.
To be compassionate is not a joke.
It's not that simple.
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
That bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the society, but it should be centered on oneself.
The self: you are self-aware.
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.
You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion.
Thank God we are empathetic.
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
In a Wimbledon final match, these two guys fight it out.
Each one has got two games.
It can be anybody's game.
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.
One person wins.
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net and shake hands.
The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
And this guy has to come to the net.
When he comes to the net, you see, his whole face changes.
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.
Why? Empathy.
That's human heart.
No human heart is denied of that empathy.
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
No culture, no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy.
And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people, you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life -- even words, even time.
Compassion is not defined in one form.
There's no Indian compassion.
There's no American compassion.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
Why? Because it is there in everybody.
It's experienced by people occasionally.
Then this occasional compassion, we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional.
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.
You can't say, "Please love me."
Love is something you discover.
It's not an action, but in the English language, it is also an action.
I will come to it later.
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience.
In spite of a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.
And the one who is happy, even for a slapstick joke, accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.
That means the whole universe, known things and unknown things.
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself.
The subject -- "me" -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness, an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of," an experience common to all and sundry.
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations -- all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards and layoffs and, finally, baldness -- you can be happy.
But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.
There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you.
It has got to be you.
You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole.
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition: "Maybe I am the whole.
Maybe the swami is right.
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.
Then everything becomes meaningful.
I have no more reason to blame myself.
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and power is therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.
Compassion is going to be limited.
Everything is going to be limitless.
You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not. Period.
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world.
It is love first.
When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is, what we say, love.
And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.
You express yourself because you have compassion.
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.
To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing.
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.
You learn swimming by swimming.
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.
You learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook.
And, therefore, what I say, you have to fake it and make it.
You need to.
My predecessor meant that.
You have to act it out.
You have to act compassionately.
There is no verb for compassion, but you have an adverb for compassion.
That's interesting to me.
You act compassionately.
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
That is where you fake.
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
You fake it and make it.
You act compassionately as though you have compassion: grind your teeth, take all the support system.
If you know how to pray, pray.
Ask for compassion.
Let me act compassionately.
Do it.
You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion, and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching, you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness, and that's what you are.
With these words, thank you very much.

<title>Edith Widder: How we found the giant squid</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Humankind has been looking for the giant squid since we first started taking pictures underwater. But the elusive deep-sea predator could never be caught on film. Oceanographer and inventor Edith Widder shares the key insight -- and the teamwork -- that helped to capture the squid on film for the first time.</description>
The Kraken, a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales, and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.
In assessing the merits of such tales, it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time," and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit."
Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale.
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean, and we now have video proof, as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan.
I'm the short one.
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.
I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED.
In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean, one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.
Mike deGruy was also invited, and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean, and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time, which is the hunt for the giant squid.
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit, a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made, farting around in the dark using these platforms, and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.
But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana, two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems.
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean, and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made.
The Johnson Sea-Link -- -- which you can probably just barely hear here, uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier.
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.
I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue.
That's visible to our eye, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line, it would just float around passively carried by the currents, and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure, which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly, because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense.
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish, but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape, and a common form of defense in the deep sea.
The approach worked.
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant, we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.
Edith Widder : Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me, now you don't -- and we had four such teasing appearances, and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.
Narrator: Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!
EW: The full monty.
What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it, which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.
But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible.
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used, a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it, a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use, and I think it was this light that brought the giant in.
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
And then he got so excited, he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better, and the giant didn't run away, so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible, bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video.
It was absolutely breathtaking, and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended, it would have been as tall as a two-story house.
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there, fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration.
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration, because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth.
We need — thank you.
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.
Innovation drives economic growth.
So let's all go exploring, but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away, or, as Mike deGruy once said, "If you want to get away from it all and see something you've never seen, or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen, get in a sub."
He should have been with us for this adventure.
We miss him.

<title>Sergey Brin: Why Google Glass?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It's not a demo, more of a philosophical argument: Why did Sergey Brin and his team at Google want to build an eye-mounted camera/computer, codenamed Glass? Onstage at TED2013, Brin calls for a new way of seeing our relationship with our mobile computers -- not hunched over a screen but meeting the world heads-up.</description>
Okay, it's great to be back at TED.
Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?
Man: Okay, Glass, record a video.
Woman: This is it. We're on in two minutes.
Man 2: Okay Glass, hang out with The Flying Club.
Man 3: Google "photos of tiger heads." Hmm.
Man 4: You ready? You ready?
Woman 2: Right there. Okay, Glass, take a picture.
Man 5: Go!
Man 6: Holy [beep]! That is awesome.
Child: Whoa! Look at that snake!
Woman 3: Okay, Glass, record a video!
Man 7: After this bridge, first exit.
Man 8: Okay, A12, right there!
Man 9: Google, say "delicious" in Thai.
Google Glass: อร่อยMan 9: Mmm, อร่อย.
Woman 4: Google "jellyfish."
Man 10: It's beautiful.
Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.
He needs help getting 10 million dollars.
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well.
this position that you just saw me in, looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.
Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life, how you want to connect to information.
Should it be by just walking around looking down?
But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor.
Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it.
In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you're out and about looking at your phone, it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?
You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass.
You're just kind of moving around.
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about, can we make something that frees your hands?
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there.
They were all wearing Glass, and that's how we got that footage.
And also you want something that frees your eyes.
That's why we put the display up high, out of your line of sight, so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people.
And also we wanted to free up the ears, so the sound actually goes through, conducts straight to the bones in your cranium, which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.
And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all.
You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.
And this is now, 15 years later, sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth.
This project has lasted now, been just over two years.
We've learned an amazing amount.
It's been really important to make it comfortable.
So our first prototypes we built were huge.
It was like cell phones strapped to your head.
It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job, and then she almost ran away screaming.
But we've come a long way.
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.
Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all, but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family, my kids.
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment.
And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device, that I also kind of have a nervous tic.
The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that, but it's also kind of a nervous habit.
Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.
I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.
You know, I'd be like -- But in this case, you know, I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to.
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away, be it email or social posts or whatnot, even though it wasn't really -- there's nothing really that important or that pressing.
And with this, I know I will get certain messages if I really need them, but I don't have to be checking them all the time.
Yeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more, doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video.
Thank you all very much.

<title>Daphne Koller: What we're learning from online education</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Daphne Koller is enticing top universities to put their most intriguing courses online for free -- not just as a service, but as a way to research how people learn. With Coursera , each keystroke, quiz, peer-to-peer discussion and self-graded assignment builds an unprecedented pool of data on how knowledge is processed.</description>
Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities, which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa, education is just not readily accessible.
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority.
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year at the University of Johannesburg.
There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process, and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration, thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long, hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
When the gates opened, there was a stampede, and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life.
But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available, it might not be within reach.
There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care.
What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate, for a total of 559 percent since 1985.
This makes education unaffordable for many people.
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education, the doors of opportunity might not open.
Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the United States who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education.
This, of course, is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions, but for many others, they do not get the value for their time and their effort.
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article, captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big Stanford classes, each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes, the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng.
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.
It's a Machine Learning class, and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public, it had 100,000 people registered.
So to put that number in perspective, for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class, he would have to do that for 250 years.
Of course, he'd get really bored.
So, having seen the impact of this, Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up, to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
So we formed Coursera, whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free.
We currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines, and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like.
Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.
Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.
We get unbelievable segregation.
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future, you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.
Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.
Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...
DK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly, that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free.
Since we opened the website in February, we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
We have 1.5 million enrollments, 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.
But it's not just about the numbers, it's also about the people.
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it.
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.
Or Ryan, who can't go to school, because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house, so he couldn't leave the house.
I'm really glad to say -- recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan -- that this story had a happy ending.
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now, and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.
So what made these courses so different?
After all, online course content has been available for a while.
What made it different was that this was real course experience.
It started on a given day, and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments.
And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade, with a real deadline.
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.
These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon.
At the end of the course, the students got a certificate.
They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job, and we know many students who did.
Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit.
So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort.
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses.
The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format, you can break away from, for example, the monolithic one-hour lecture.
You can break up the material, for example, into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes, each of which represents a coherent concept.
Students can traverse this material in different ways, depending on their background, their skills or their interests.
So, for example, some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have.
Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
So this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education, and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.
Of course, we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it.
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example, demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice, where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions.
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform, as well as other forms of practice in many ways.
For example, even our videos are not just videos.
Every few minutes, the video pauses and the students get asked a question.
SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.
DK: So here the video pauses, and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.
So they get to try again, and this time they got it right.
There's an optional explanation if they want.
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.
This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class, but when I ask that kind of a question in class, 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said, 15 percent are zoned out on Facebook, and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it, and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer.
And so the lecture moves on before, really, most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
Here, every single student has to engage with the material.
And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story.
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions, and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions.
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs?
The answer is, you need to use technology to do it for you.
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way, and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.
In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video, we can also grade math, mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations.
We can grade models, whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple but fairly visual.
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class, and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image.
They're typing their program into the browser, and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that, and they can move on to the next assignment.
This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning.
Now, of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses.
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.
So we tried to convince, for example, some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
That didn't go over really well.
So we had to come up with a different solution.
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.
It turns out that previous studies show, like this one by Saddler and Good, that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades.
It was tried only in small classes, but there it showed, for example, that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.
What's even more surprising is that self-grades, where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.
And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale, and is also a useful learning strategy for the students, because they actually learn from the experience.
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised, where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work, and quite successfully, I have to say.
But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems.
Around each one of our courses, a community of students had formed, a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor.
What you see here is a self-generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course, where they have put themselves on a world map, and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
First of all, there was a question and answer forum, where students would pose questions, and other students would answer those questions.
And the really amazing thing is, because there were so many students, it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o'clock in the morning, somewhere around the world, there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem.
And so, in many of our courses, the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community, they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.
Students also self-assembled, without any kind of intervention from us, into small study groups.
Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
This is the San Francisco study group, but there were ones all over the world.
Others were virtual study groups, sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines, and on the bottom left there, you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures.
There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework.
The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning.
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.
You can collect every click, every homework submission, every forum post from tens of thousands of students.
So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode, a transformation that, for example, has revolutionized biology.
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions like, what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not?
And in the context of particular courses, you can ask questions like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them?
So here's an example of that, also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.
This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments.
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers, so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
The big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer.
Now, if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer, you would never notice.
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer, it's kind of hard to miss.
So Andrew and his students went in, looked at some of those assignments, understood the root cause of the misconception, and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket, which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers.
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem.
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984, posed what's called the 2 sigma problem, which he observed by studying three populations.
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
The second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture-based classroom, but with a mastery-based approach, so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.
And finally, there was a population of students that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation, or sigma, in achievement scores better than the standard lecture-based class, and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma improvement in performance.
To understand what that means, let's look at the lecture-based classroom, and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.
So in a lecture-based class, half the students are above that level and half are below.
In the individual tutoring instruction, 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average.
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.
Because we cannot afford, as a society, to provide every student with an individual human tutor.
But maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone.
So the question is, how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve, to the right side with the green curve?
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer, because a computer doesn't get tired of showing you the same video five times.
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times, we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.
And even personalization is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of, whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.
So the goal here is to try and push, and see how far we can get towards the green curve.
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either."
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on.
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch, who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting."
And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity, their imagination and their problem-solving skills by actually talking with them.
So how do we do that?
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
So there's been many studies, including this one, that show that if you use active learning, interacting with your students in the classroom, performance improves on every single metric -- on attendance, on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test.
You can see, for example, that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment.
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free, what would that do? Three things.
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right, where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves, their families and their communities.
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.
It's a shame that for so many people, learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.
By having this amazing content be available, we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted, whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives.
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation, because amazing talent can be found anywhere.
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.
And if we could offer that person an education, they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us.
Thank you very much.

<title>Maurizio Seracini: The secret lives of paintings</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Art history is far from set in stone. Engineer Maurizio Seracini spent 30 years searching for Leonardo da Vinci’s lost fresco “The Battle of Anghiari,” and in the process discovered that many paintings have layers of history hidden underneath. Should they be part of the viewing experience too?</description>
In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti, my former professor of art history, and today a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so I decided, with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo.
Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking, because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling, and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494, and to find out the original doors, windows, and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model, and then, with thermography, we went on to discover hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore, all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari, and restructured the whole thing, including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari" on a specific area of one of the two walls.
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family, we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap.
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo, since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall, an air gap, and that's where we believe "The Battle of Anghiari," or at least the part that we know has been painted, which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.
Well, from there, unfortunately, in 2004, the project came to a halt. Many political reasons.
So I decided to go back to my alma mater, and, at the University of California, San Diego, and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture and archaeology. So students started to flow in, and we started to build technologies, because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork.
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011, and this time, with a great group of students, and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester, who is now the director at CISA3, and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left.
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say, for several reasons that it's not worth explaining, to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had, and with a 4mm camera attached to it, we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color, black color, and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams, XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well, those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo.
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind.
As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had, and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named the number one artist influence at the time.
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me, but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example, the state of conservation. See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another, different lady, aged lady, I should rather say.
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches, and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.
But also, technology has helped to write new pages of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn," another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
And — — no problem, but, unfortunately, continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn, did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — — unfortunately, is not very reliable.
Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution, let me add. Take this example: Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life" at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through, and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says when it was made and also the location.
So that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good, and so, again, authenticity and science could go together and change the way, not attributions being made, but at least lay the ground for a more objective, or, I should rather say, less subjective attribution, as it is done today.
But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer, brown layer, of "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it, and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath.
Well, this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries. Look at these portraits.
They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.
You see the geniality of his creation, right directly on the ground layer of the panel, and see this cool thing, finding, I should rather say, an elephant. Because of this elephant, over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.
This was an epiphany. We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have this pleasure, this privilege to see all this, to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?
So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing, any of us could be doing, in a museum environment.
So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.
Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause, and now let me turn to you so the moment the image, or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting, then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded. And so, see.
We can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.
Okay? Let's go and find the elephant.
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant.
Okay? And then if we want, we can continue the scroll to find out, for example, on the staircase, the whole iconography is going to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple, and there are a lot of figures showing up. See?
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology, the meaning of the painting, and we believe this is a cool way, easy way, that everybody could have access to, to become more the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums.
Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients, but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately, it's never been tapped as an idea.
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning, the very first step, to do real conservation, and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation, the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting.
Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together.
We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values, these cultural values that we badly need, especially today.
And if you want to summarize in one just single word, well, this is what we're trying to do.
We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future.
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion, there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you.

<title>Eric Whitacre: Virtual Choir Live</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Composer and conductor Eric Whitacre has inspired millions by bringing together "virtual choirs," singers from many countries spliced together on video. Now, for the first time ever, he creates the experience in real time, as 32 singers from around the world Skype in to join an onstage choir for an epic performance of Whitacre's "Cloudburst," based on a poem by Octavio Paz.</description>
In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life.
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.
I took a couple victory laps in there.
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California, and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus, and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains.
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise, and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us, and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley, so help me God, every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time.
This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.
And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called "Cloudburst," which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.
Now fast forward to just three years ago.
And we released to YouTube this, the Virtual Choir Project, 185 singers from 12 different countries.
You can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home.
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3, "Water Night," another piece that I had written, this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.
Could we do this all in real time?
Could we have people singing together in real time?
And with the help of Skype, that is what we are going to attempt today.
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and — -- and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries.
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go, but there's still less than a second of latency, but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.
We deal in milliseconds.
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together.
So with deep humility, and for your approval, we present "Cloudburst."
[The rain ...] [Eyes of shadow-water] [eyes of well-water] [eyes of dream-water.] [Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.] [But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?] [Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?] [The rain awakens...] [We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.] [We must dream aloud,] [we must sing till the song puts forth roots,] [trunk, branches, birds, stars.] [We must find the lost word,] [and remember what the blood,] [the tides, the earth, and the body say,] [and return to the point of departure...] ["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre] Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you? Jacob.
Thank you.

<title>Laura Trice: Remember to say thank you</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this deceptively simple 3-minute talk, Dr. Laura Trice muses on the power of the magic words "thank you" -- to deepen a friendship, to repair a bond, to make sure another person knows what they mean to you. Try it.</description>
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine.
And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it.
And I asked myself, why?
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
And then my question became, am I the only one who does this?
So, I decided to investigate.
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the son.
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, "Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids," but won't ask.
I know a woman who's good at this.
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, "I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that.
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten, she thanks her children for doing their chores.
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?
Why were other people blocking it?
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?"
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.
I'm telling you where I need your help.
And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy.
Because what can you do with that data?
You could neglect me.
You could abuse it.
Or you could actually meet my need.
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better."
I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife -- go ask her, what does she need?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.
And it's simple.
And why should we care about this?
We talk about world peace.
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons.
And maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job.
And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas.
Thank you.

<title>Carter Emmart: A 3D atlas of the universe</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For the last 12 years, Carter Emmart has been coordinating the efforts of scientists, artists and programmers to build a complete 3D visualization of our known universe. He demos this stunning tour and explains how it's being shared with facilities around the world.</description>
It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe, which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe.
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.
[The Himalayas.] The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite: unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste.
It wasn't until we really left Earth, got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself, that we could understand our planet as a limited condition.
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past 12 years.
We maintain that, put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales.
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe, as we see.
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world.
The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome.
But what you see here is the result of, actually, internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden.
I've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work, and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden.
This software allows interactive use, so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live.
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live, and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology.
And so as we move out, we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here, light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.
the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long, we're essentially backing up into the past.
We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us -- the afterglow of the Big Bang.
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see.
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.
If we were outside this, it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.
But this our containment of the visible universe.
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.
Coming back quickly, we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning, but these are positions, the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped, and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10, the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.
Coming in closer, picking up Earth, orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.
This map can be updated, and we can add in new data.
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission.
But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases, ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan, which is larger that the planet Mercury, diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this.
This software can also be networked between domes.
We have a growing user base of this, and we network domes.
And we can network between domes and classrooms.
We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia.
And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.
This is an image from Saturday, photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.
This is Nepal.
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa, right here in Tibet.
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India.
This is Nepal and Tibet.
And just in closing, I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -- so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is.
Because our home is the universe, and we are the universe, essentially.
We carry that in us.
And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all, I think, in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe.
Thank you.

<title>Nalini Nadkarni: Life science in prison</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nalini Nadkarni challenges our perspective on trees and prisons -- she says both can be more dynamic than we think. Through a partnership with the state of Washington, she brings science classes and conservation programs to inmates, with unexpected results.</description>
Trees epitomize stasis.
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing.
And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists.
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art.
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines.
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.
And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year.
You might have a guess.
The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe.
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic.
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons.
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars.
And our prison system itself is stuck.
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women.
That number is rising.
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison.
Funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes.
In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections.
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons.
We give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting.
That, I think, is movement.
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.
That, I think, is movement.
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands.
That, I think, is movement.
And just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities.
They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners.
They're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day.
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, they're placed in immobile booths like this.
For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature.
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence.
And so what we see, I think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope.
We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks.
But if trees can create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change.
Thank you very much.

<title>Michael Hansmeyer: Building unimaginable shapes</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Inspired by cell division, Michael Hansmeyer writes algorithms that design outrageously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of facets. No person could draft them by hand, but they're buildable -- and they could revolutionize the way we think of architectural form.</description>
As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design?
What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore?
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions, what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience?
If we could free ourselves from our education?
What would these unseen forms look like?
Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?
Would they delight us?
If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?
I propose we look to nature.
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.
And I'm not saying that we should copy nature, I'm not saying we should mimic biology, instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.
We can abstract them and to create something that is new.
Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis, is the splitting of one cell into two cells.
And these cells can either be identical, or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division.
If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible, then we could start with a single sheet of paper, one surface, and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces.
We're free to choose where we make the fold.
And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.
Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.
Now, we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures, but rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm.
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.
We can fold a million times faster, we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.
And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional, we start not with a single surface, but with a volume.
A simple volume, the cube.
If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again, then after 16 iterations, 16 steps, we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks, for instance, like this.
And if we change where we make the folds, if we change the folding ratio, then this cube turns into this one.
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape, or this shape.
So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold, but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.
And we can play with this.
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions.
We can begin to sculpt the form.
And because we're doing the folding on the computer, we are completely free of any physical constraints.
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves, they can become impossibly small.
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.
Surfaces can become porous.
They can stretch. They can tear.
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.
But in each case, I didn't design the form.
I designed the process that generated the form.
In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio, which is what you're seeing here, then the form changes correspondingly.
But that's only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this, but this, the geometric equivalent of noise.
The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error.
A far more effective way to create forms, I have found, is to use information that is already contained in forms.
A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.
So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.
White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature, how radial they are -- all information that may not be instantly visible to you, but that we can bring out, that we can articulate, and that we can use to control the folding.
So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule, I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded.
And because I've designed the process and not the form, I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms.
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.
There is a simple input, it's always a cube that I start with, and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold, and doing this over and over again.
So let's bring this process to architecture.
How? And at what scale?
I chose to design a column.
Columns are architectural archetypes.
They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty, about technology.
A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column.
I started using four cylinders.
Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders eventually evolved into this.
And these columns, they have information at very many scales.
We can begin to zoom into them.
The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.
And unlike traditional architecture, it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail.
These forms are undrawable.
An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months, or it would take even a year to draw all the sections, all of the elevations, you can only create something like this through an algorithm.
The more interesting question, perhaps, is, are these forms imaginable?
Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing.
In this case, the process is deterministic.
There's no randomness involved at all, but it's not entirely predictable.
There's too many surfaces, there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.
So this leads to a new role for the architect.
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there.
For one thing, one can design many variants of a form, in parallel, and one can cultivate them.
And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.
And the architect is really, he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.
But enough of the theory.
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue 3D glasses, got up very close to the screen, but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things.
So there was only one possibility -- to bring the column out of the computer.
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.
For me, or for my purpose at this moment, there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.
So instead, we decided to take the column, and we decided to build it as a layered model, made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.
What you're looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.
Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside of the column, which was quite a surprising discovery.
From this shape, we calculated a cutting line, and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.
And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering, and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer.
Almost all of the details, almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved.
But it was very labor intensive.
There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical.
It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.
The physical model, on the other hand, is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick, it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium.
And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again.
But it is increasingly possible.
Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive, and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon.
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale.
And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns, we used the bigger, faster machine, and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural, they can bear loads for once.
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.
You can see a different column in the mirror, if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion.
So where does this leave us?
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object, but a process to generate objects.
I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature; there's countless other ones.
In short, we have no constraints.
Instead, we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up.
And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.
Thank you.

<title>David Hoffman: Sputnik mania</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Filmmaker David Hoffman shares footage from his feature-length documentary Sputnik Mania, which shows how the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957 led to both the space race and the arms race -- and jump-started science and math education around the world.</description>
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union, a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside.
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space.
The rocket was huge.
And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside.
On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time: "We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik.
In the olden days, explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."
You're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature, which is just about completed.
It tells the story of Sputnik, and the story of what happened to America as a result.
For days after the launch, Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens, it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space.
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
All hell broke loose.
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America -- historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.
It provoked the missile gap.
It exploded an arms race.
It began the space race.
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.
For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen, and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed.
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.
For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik.
Support for engineering, math and science -- education in general -- boomed.
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA, and the Internet, and, of course, NASA.
My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.
But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation, into something that was overall very good for America.
"Sputnik" will soon be released.
In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors: longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.
And I'd like to thank you all.
Thank you, Chris.

<title>Ken Kamler: Medical miracle on Everest</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The second deadliest day in the history of Mount Everest climbs happened in 1996 -- and Ken Kamler was the only doctor on the mountain that day. He shares the incredible story of the climbers' battle to save lives in extreme conditions, and uses brain imaging technology to map the medical miracle of one man who survived roughly 36 hours buried in the snow.</description>
OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind.
And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation, how the will to survive can bring that out in people.
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest; it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive.
OK, this is Mount Everest.
It's 29,035 feet high.
I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic, making tectonic plate measurements; twice, I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices.
It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.
And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen, and we should have listened to them.
Everest is an extreme environment.
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.
Near the summit, temperatures can be 40 degrees below zero.
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.
It's actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars.
I remember one time being up near the summit, I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle, inside my down jacket, only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit.
OK, this is the route up Everest.
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.
Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.
Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up, what's called the Western Cwm.
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse, which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.
And then Camp Four is the highest camp; that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.
This is a view of base camp.
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.
It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload.
And this is what they unloaded for me: I had four yak loads of medical supplies, which are dumped in a tent, and here I am trying to arrange things.
This was our expedition.
It was a National Geographic expedition, but it was organized by The Explorers Club.
There were three other expeditions on the mountain, an American team, a New Zealand team and an IMAX team.
And, after actually two months of preparation, we built our camps all the way up the mountain.
This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp.
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day.
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze; you can't even see over the top.
This is near the top of the icefall.
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.
This is me crossing a crevasse.
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.
That's another crevasse.
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more, and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over, we would never do it.
Okay. This is Camp One.
It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall.
And from there we climb up to Camp Two, which is sort of the foreground.
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face, that mountain toward Camp Three.
They're on fixed ropes here.
A fall here, if you weren't roped in, would be 5,000 feet down.
This is a view taken from camp three.
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile, it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it, so you put the camp halfway through.
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.
There's no ice over it.
And that's because Everest is so high, it's in the jet stream, and winds are constantly scouring the face, so no snow gets to accumulate.
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit.
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four, moving in, up through the clouds.
And this is at Camp Four.
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited, and you either have to go up or go down, make that decision very quickly.
This is a picture of Rob Hall.
He was the leader of the New Zealand team.
This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about.
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.
They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.
This is not good weather to climb in, so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.
And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.
It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face.
It's the first part of climb.
It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next, and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.
So that's what happened.
The climbers got on the southeast ridge.
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.
The summit would be in the foreground.
From here, it's about 1,500 feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.
You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit.
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.
This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before, and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather.
I have an oxygen hose connected here.
You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack -- little titanium tanks, very lightweight -- and we're not carrying much else.
This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.
OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.
This is on the way toward the summit, on that 1,500-foot bridge.
All the climbers here are climbing unroped, and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody, you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.
So each person climbs individually.
And it's not a straight path at all, it's very difficult climbing, and there's always the risk of falling on either side.
If you fall to your left, you're going to fall 8,000 feet into Nepal; if you fall to your right, you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.
So it's probably better to fall into Tibet because you'll live longer.
But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.
OK. Those climbers were up near the summit, along that summit ridge that you see up there, and I was down here in Camp Three.
My expedition was down in Camp Three, while these guys were up there in the storm.
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay, fully dressed, fully equipped, laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.
It was the worst winds I've ever seen.
And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher, and completely exposed to the elements.
We were in radio contact with some of them.
This is a view taken along the summit ridge.
Rob Hall, we heard by radio, was up here, at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen.
And we heard that Rob was OK, but Doug was too weak to come down.
He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.
We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers, another climber, had collapsed in the snow and was dead.
There were still 18 other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition.
They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain; all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm.
We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three.
Our two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans, decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going.
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall, who was a superb climber stuck, sort of, with a weak climber up near the summit.
I expected them to say to Rob, "Hold on. We're coming."
But in fact, what they said was, "Leave Doug and come down yourself.
There's no chance of saving him, and just try to save yourself at this point."
And Rob got that message, but his answer was, "We're both listening."
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here, and it was a scene of complete chaos up there.
But they did what they could to stabilize the people.
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three, and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power.
The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.
So the climbers were coming down along this route.
This is taken from Camp Three, where I was.
And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them, which is really not much, because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle.
You can barely stand outside the tent.
It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.
The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids.
So, as the climbers came by me, I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down.
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated, I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain.
It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes.
It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there.
While I was taking care of them, we got more news about Rob Hall.
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.
He called in to say that he was alone now.
Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself, and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude, he was just beyond rescue and he knew it.
At that point, he asked to be paged into his wife.
He was carrying a radio.
His wife was home in New Zealand, seven months pregnant with their first child, and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done, and Rob and his wife had their last conversation.
They picked the name for their baby.
Rob then signed off, and that was the last we ever heard of him.
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24,000 feet, which was an impossibility.
So what we did was, we got the victims down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.
This was my medical kit.
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.
This is what I carried up the mountain.
I had more supplies lower down, which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.
And this was scene at the lower camp.
The survivors came in one by one.
Some of them were hypothermic, some of them were frostbitten, some were both.
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could, put oxygen on them and try to revive them, which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet, when the tent is freezing.
This is some severe frostbite on the feet, severe frostbite on the nose.
This climber was snow blind.
As I was taking care of these climbers, we got a startling experience.
Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers, who we had already been told was dead, stumbled into the tent, just like a mummy, he walked into the tent.
I expected him to be incoherent, but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me, "Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?"
And then he said, "Do you accept my health insurance?"
He really said that.
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.
You can see his hand is completely white; his face, his nose, is burned.
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis, it turns black, and then it falls off.
It's the last stage, just like a scar.
So, as I was taking care of Beck, he related what had been going on up there.
He said he had gotten lost in the storm, collapsed in the snow, and just laid there, unable to move.
Some climbers had come by and looked at him, and he heard them say, "He's dead."
But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that, but he was completely unable to move.
He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings, but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.
So the climbers passed him by, and Beck lay there for a day, a night and another day, in the snow.
And then he said to himself, "I don't want to die.
I have a family to come back to."
And the thoughts of his family, his kids and his wife, generated enough energy, enough motivation in him, so that he actually got up.
After laying in the snow that long a time, he got up and found his way back to the camp.
And Beck told me that story very quietly, but I was absolutely stunned by it.
I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up.
He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia.
And I can only try to speculate on how he did it.
So, what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan, something that could actually measure brain function?
Just very simply, the three parts of the brain: the frontal lobe, where you focus your attention and concentration; you have the temporal lobe, where you form images and keep memories; and the posterior part of your brain, which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion; and the brain stem, where you have your basic maintenance functions, like heartbeat and respiration.
So let's take a cut through the brain here, and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan.
This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain.
So you have the prefrontal cortex here, lighting up in red.
This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.
You have the middle area, where the temporal lobe might be, in here, and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.
This is a roughly normal scan, showing equal distribution of energy.
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up.
This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger.
He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble.
These parts of the brain are quieting down.
He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point, and he's working pretty hard.
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.
OK, but he's losing ground here.
He's running out of energy.
It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going, and, you see, there's no more red here; his brain is quieting down.
He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet, there's very little red anywhere.
Beck is powering down.
He's dying.
You go on to the next scan, but, in Beck's case, you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again.
He's beginning to think about his family.
He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up.
He's developing energy in this area through thought.
And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action.
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.
It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists.
This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.
And, you can see, there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain, where he's got images of his family, into this area, which is powering his will.
Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor.
He's going to develop enough energy in that area -- after a day, a night and a day -- to actually motivate himself to get up.
And you can see here, he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.
He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.
So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain, and it's getting quieter down here, but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going.
And then, that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas.
He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.
This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving, and he's going to be pacing himself.
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic.
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet, and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself.
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients; luckily, we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys.
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.
It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck and the other survivors, one by one, and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp.
This is a scene at base camp, at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost.
And we had a memorial service there a few days later.
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.
They believe juniper smoke is holy.
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit, turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.
There were five climbers lost here.
This was Scott Fischer, Rob Hall, Andy Harris, Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba.
And one more climber should have died that day, but didn't, and that's Beck Weathers.
He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower, he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself.
These are Tibetan prayer flags.
These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags, the message will be carried up to the gods, and that year, Beck's message was answered.
Thank you.

<title>Tyrone Hayes + Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: The toxic baby</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Filmmaker Penelope Jagessar Chaffer was curious about the chemicals she was exposed to while pregnant: Could they affect her unborn child? So she asked scientist Tyrone Hayes to brief her on one he studied closely: atrazine, a herbicide used on corn. Onstage together at TEDWomen, Hayes and Chaffer tell their story.</description>
Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.
No, I'm just joking.
It's interesting, because it was six years ago when I was pregnant with my first child that I discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body.
Now it's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin.
And these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors.
That was the start of my journey to make this film, "Toxic Baby."
And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue.
One is that you and I all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn't have.
And many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we're seeing across industrialized nations.
I'll show you some statistics.
So for example, in the United Kingdom, the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.
Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.
That's a four-fold increase.
Again, similar story around the world.
In the United States, probably the most astonishing statistic is a 600 percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities.
Again, we're seeing that trend across Europe, across North America.
And in Europe, there's certain parts of Europe, where we're seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects.
Interestingly, one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.
So a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes, premature puberty.
So it's interesting for me, when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things, that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs.
Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well that I would be talking about pesticides, that I'd be talking about public health, because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.
Frogs.
In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if I would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world.
It's the number one contaminant of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.
In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union, but in that same year, the United States EPA re-registered the compound.
We were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion -- that it produced animals that look like this.
These are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes, two ovaries, another large testis, more ovaries, which is not normal ...
even for amphibians.
In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.
And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male's testes.
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well, that there's nothing more painful than childbirth -- which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that -- but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five.
In recent studies that we've published, we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine, some of the males grow up and completely become females.
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.
And not only do these genetic males mate with other males, they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they're genetic males.
What we proposed, and what we've now generated support for, is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.
Normally the testes should make testosterone, the male hormone.
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme, the machinery if you will, aromatase, that converts testosterone into estrogen.
And as a result, these exposed males lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated, and they're subsequently feminized because now they're making the female hormone.
Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.
Because it turns out that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer, is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast, aromatase converts androgens into estrogens, and that estrogen turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.
In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole, which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen, so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.
Now what's interesting is, of course, that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine, the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite -- turns on aromatase, increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.
What's interesting is, in fact, the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine, the breast cancer promoter, now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.
And so I find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it, we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment.
PJC: So speaking of estrogen, one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol A, BPA, which has been in the news recently.
It's a plasticizer.
It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic, which is what baby bottles are made out of.
And what's interesting about BPA is that it's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.
And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown that BPA leaches from babies' bottles into the formula, into the milk, and therefore into the babies.
So we're dosing our babies, our newborns, our infants, with a synthetic estrogen.
Now two weeks ago or so, the European Union passed a law banning the use of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups.
And for those of you who are not parents, sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles.
But just two weeks before that, the U.S. Senate refused to even debate the banning of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups.
So it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is.
PJC: With many plastic baby bottles now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A, it really shows how sometimes it is only a parent's awareness that stands between chemicals and our children.
The baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.
However, if we parents are unaware, we are leaving our children to fend for themselves.
TH: And what Penelope says here is even more true.
For those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.
Scientists agree now.
We are losing species from the Earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared, and leading that loss are amphibians.
80 percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline.
And I believe, many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline.
In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water -- no eggshells, no membranes and no placenta.
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals -- one of our big inventions was the placenta.
But we also start out as aquatic organisms.
But it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals, the placenta, cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals that it's never seen before.
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine, show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.
Of those rats that don't abort, atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man's disease.
Of those that don't abort, atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development in the exposed daughters in utero, so that their breast don't develop properly.
And as a result, when those rats grow up, their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to.
And given the life of many of these chemicals, generations, years, dozens of years, that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today.
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known, that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen, PCBs, DDT cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby's in the womb.
In addition to that, after the baby's born, our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.
We already know that chemicals like DDT and DES and atrazine can also pass over into milk, again, affecting our babies even after their born.
PJC: So when Tyrone tells me that the placenta is an ancient organ, I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?
How do you show that?
And it's interesting when you make a film like this, because you're stuck trying to visualize science that there's no visualization for.
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license.
Old man: Placenta control.
What is it?
Oh what?
Puffuffuff, what?
Perflourooctanoic acid.
Blimey.
Never heard of it.
PJC: And neither had I actually before I started making this film.
And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child, it made me start to think, what would my fetus say to me?
What would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure that's happening everyday, day after day?
Child: Today, I had some octyphenols, some artificial musks and some bisphenol A.
Help me.
PJC: It's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this.
This is our issue, because we collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children.
We are in effect polluting our children.
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when I found out I was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat.
So my child's death, my baby's death, really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.
And it's sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story, which is not what you originally intend.
And so when Tyrone talks about the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment, this is my contaminated environment.
This is my toxic baby.
And that's something that's just profound and sad, but astonishing because so many of us don't actually know this.
TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at TEDWomen is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them, 'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'" The truth is, women, you've had our back on this issue for a very long time, starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future" to Sandra Steingraber's books "Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area.
But for the men here, I want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk.
And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine, the testes are full of holes and spaces, because the hormone imbalance, instead of allowing sperm to be generated, such as in the testis here, the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.
It's not just my work in amphibians, but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe, holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America and in rats, an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well.
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans, but just by coincidence, my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine.
These are just men who live in an agricultural community.
Men who actually work in agriculture have much higher levels of atrazine.
And the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine in their urine, up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men.
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.
They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin, which was originally used as a nerve gas.
And many of these workers have life expectancies of only 50.
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us, just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.
As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda, the agricultural runoff from this crop, which goes into these buckets, is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.
Now if I told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes, the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear.
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it.
The problem is, in my village, Oakland, in most of our villages, we don't see that connection.
We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe, and we assume that we are masters of our environment, rather than being part of it.
PJC: So it doesn't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue.
And I kept thinking over and over again this question.
We know so much about global warming and climate change, and yet, we have no concept of what I've been calling internal environmentalism.
We know what we're putting out there, we have a sense of those repercussions, but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things, or things are put into our bodies.
And it's my feeling and it's my urging being here to know that, as we women move forward as the communicators of this, but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children, bearing the children, we hold most of the buying power in the household, is that it's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.
And my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps, but it's also about our children as well.
Thank you.

<title>Abha Dawesar: Life in the "digital now"</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: One year ago, Abha Dawesar was living in blacked-out Manhattan post-Sandy, scrounging for power to connect. As a novelist, she was struck by this metaphor: Have our lives now become fixated on the drive to digitally connect, while we miss out on what's real?</description>
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me.
Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side.
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up.
I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day.
And through all of this, I had to hold a torch between my teeth.
The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread.
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym.
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices.
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.
I wasn't the only one.
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street.
Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.
I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not, and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter.
The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become a part of our identity, and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.
I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common.
They're both stories, interpretations.
You and I can experience things without a story.
We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless.
But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.
Our story of our life is based on direct experience, but it's embellished.
A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well.
It needs months and years.
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.
But the story is not about these chapters.
It's the whole book.
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves.
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment.
Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time.
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose.
Without it, we would have no music.
Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time, regret or nostalgia about the past, hope or dread about the future.
I think that technology has altered that flow of time.
The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time, and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world, and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers.
All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen.
Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second.
You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations.
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations.
What happens when that arrow goes awry?
What happens when time warps?
So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once.
This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one.
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time.
Far away over there is now here.
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.
And that's not all.
Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year, your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends, because the Internet also archives, and it warps the past.
With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, and the here or there, we are left with this moment everywhere, this moment that I'll call the digital now.
Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now?
This digital now is not the present, because it's always a few seconds ahead, with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones.
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.
This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state.
Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road.
Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else.
Are you reading an interview by an author?
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
Like it. Find other books exactly like his.
Find other people reading those books.
Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose.
Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly for its own sake.
Not just is the digital now far from the present, but it's in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you.
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night, shop for Parisian macarons, and leave video messages that get picked up later.
At all times, I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you, while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time.
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter.
There were those with power and water, and those without.
There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months.
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true.
For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets.
Now if this rift, which is already so great in many parts of the world, between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology, isn't somehow bridged, there will be ruptures between the digital and the real.
For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous.
How does one live inside distraction?
We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.
Possibly, but I remember my childhood.
I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me.
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.
If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldn't be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact.
Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable.
We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments.
They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.
By archiving everything, we think that we can store it, but time is not data.
It cannot be stored.
You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment.
It might have happened while we were playing an instrument, or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time.
At such moments, our selves are complete.
The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one.
The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future.
The present joins a flow of time from before and after.
I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.
I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it.
I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention.
Attention is time.
One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing.
The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves.
It threatens the flow of love.
But we don't need to let it.
We can choose otherwise.
We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be, and in our lives and in our actions, we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it.
We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time.
We can choose to take time back.
Thank you.

<title>Yves Behar: Designing objects that tell stories</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Designer Yves Behar digs up his creative roots to discuss some of the iconic objects he's created . Then he turns to the witty, surprising, elegant objects he's working on now -- including the "$100 laptop."</description>
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house, I remember these Turkish carpets, and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier.
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week, of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories, so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.
And then there was another influence.
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
And so, I fused together the two things I loved the most, which was skiing and windsurfing.
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.
So, I created this compilation of the two: I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there, and some foot straps, and some metal fins, and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.
It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible, it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.
And I realized then I had to go to design school.
I mean, look at those graphics there.
So, I went to design school, and it was the early '90s when I finished.
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley, so I wanted to be there, and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes, that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, "Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."
And they would give the projects code names, you know, mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand, and I would ask questions.
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions, but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"
or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?
"You know, do people really use it?
Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"
What I realized then is, they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins, to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
And I didn't want to be a colorist.
It wasn't what I wanted to do.
I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.
And then I saw this quote: "advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco, and I started a little company, fuseproject.
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
And so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality.
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical.
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here, without bending my elbow.
And other projects, which were really about transformation, about matching the human need.
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer, and it ships completely flat, and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.
And something a little bit more experimental: this is a light fixture for Swarovski, and what it does is, it changes shape.
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet, the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.
This is a pretty involved process; it took us about four and a half years.
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light, a new experience of light.
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light.
So, the light bulb actually does that.
It allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations.
And it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light.
So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them, and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world, whether it's for business, or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value.
And the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption.
You know, they can be about function and beauty; they can be about business strategy.
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together.
So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with, and it has a humanistic technology.
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin, and it knows when it is you're talking.
And by knowing when it is you're talking, it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about, which is the environmental noises.
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can.
I mean, think about it: the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry, or accessories is really important, so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.
And this is what we're pursuing here.
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.
I want to point at something here, on the left.
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work.
But this is the design process: there's somebody changing the board, putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs, as the designers on the other side are doing the work.
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.
It's really about designing from the inside out.
And then, on the other side of the room, the designers are making small adjustments, sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
And it's what I call being design driven.
You know, there is some push and pull, but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out.
And then, of course, design is never done.
And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff.
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue to really touch the user, in many ways.
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone, you know, really understands that you need a different structure.
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners, it's a partnership. We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project, and then we also share in the rewards.
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.
This is called Y Water, and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, Austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he's trying to get them away from.
So, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
The bottles connect together, and you can create different shapes, different forms.
Thank you.
And then while we were doing this, the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y, and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not," are probably the most important words that kids ask.
So we called it Y Water. And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room: the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding, it all becomes deeply connected.
And then the other thing about this project is, we bring intellectual property, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day, what we bring is these values, and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.
And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor, when others can be creative and do more with it.
Here's another project, which I think really emulates that.
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.
This picture is incredible.
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
I mean, to me, it just means so much.
But when Nicholas Negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot, he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us about two and a half years ago, there were some clear ideas.
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology, and those are pillars of his life, but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.
And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.
But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust.
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key -- -- and the Num Lock key, too.
So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic, to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
And then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment.
You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers.
They fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers.
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is.
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea.
And I think this is something really important.
So, now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers, and in Mongolia.
And we went away from obviously the beige.
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
It's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the X and the O, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there.
So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back. It was hard.
And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later, I come back to Switzerland, and there he is playing with his own version.
Like paper, paper and cardboard.
So, I'm going to finish with one last project, and this is a little bit more of adult play.
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago.
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant, and it has to be easily serviceable: you have to know where it is and what it does.
And we also designed the condoms themselves.
And I was just in New York at the launch, and I went to see all these places where they're installed: this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store; at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.
Of course, clubs and discos, too.
And here's the public service announcement for this project.
Get some.
So, this is really where design is able to create a conversation.
I was in these venues, and people were, you know, really into getting them. They were excited.
It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do.
So, I was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot, but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.
Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.
So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom, you can just say you like the design.
So, I'll finish with just one thought: if we all work together on creating value, but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do, I think we can change the work that we do.
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.
So, thank you.

<title>Dave Eggers: My wish: Once Upon a School</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Accepting his 2008 TED Prize, author Dave Eggers asks the TED community to personally, creatively engage with local public schools. With spellbinding eagerness, he talks about how his 826 Valencia tutoring center inspired others around the world to open</description>
Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.
I cannot believe I'm here.
I have not slept in weeks.
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous -- and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized.
So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things.
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn, I was trying to finish my first book, I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
So I would walk around in a daze during the day.
I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope, there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people.
Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.
My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching.
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were, and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew.
But I knew so many of the things they were up against, so many of the struggles they were dealing with.
And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level, in their reading and writing in particular.
Now, so many of these students had come from households where English isn't spoken in the home, where a lot of them have different special needs, learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded.
And so they would talk to me about this and say, "You know, what we really need is just more people, more bodies, more one-on-one attention, more hours, more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."
Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.
This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.
How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"
You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.
And so we started talking about this.
And at the same time, I thought about this massive group of people I knew: writers, editors, journalists, graduate students, assistant professors, you name it.
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word -- I hope to have an interest in the English language, but I'm not speaking it well right now.
I'm trying. That clock has got me.
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.
And so they had, you know, their time and their interest, but at the same time there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together.
So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.
And the idea was to put McSweeney's -- McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year, and a few other magazines -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time.
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.
We were going to move it into an office, and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway, why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school, get extra help on their written homework, so you have basically no border between these two communities?"
So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on, at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing, or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.
You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood.
So, we had this place, we rented it, the landlord was all for it. We did this mural, that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.
So we rented this space.
And everything was great except the landlord said, "Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.
You've gotta sell something.
You can't just have a tutoring center."
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell, but we did all the necessary research.
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below, acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors, whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place, somebody said, "You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."
And we looked around and somebody else said, "Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer."
And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh, and we said, "There's a point to that.
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see, we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.
Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy.
We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display, which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night -- special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.
So we opened this place. And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in.
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.
These are some signs that we have all over the place: "Practical Joking with Pirates."
While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head.
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater, which is just a saltwater tank with three seats, and then right behind it we set up this space, which was the tutoring center.
So right there is the tutoring center, and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices, where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.
The kids would come in -- or we thought they would come in. I should back up.
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months renovating this place.
We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.
Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.
It was started with about 12 of my friends, people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.
And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free."
And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates, they're gonna love it." And they didn't.
And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.
And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.
And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap, because we were operating behind a pirate supply store.
We never put it together, you know?
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari, a longtime San Francisco educator -- she was teaching in Mexico City, she had all the experience necessary, knew everything about education, was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood -- I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.
She took over as executive director.
Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything, and so suddenly it was actually full every day.
And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention.
The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.
You know, it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention, a student can get one grade level higher.
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.
They come there, many times their parents -- you can't see it, but there's a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there -- the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.
So that was the basis of it, was one-on-one attention.
And we found ourselves full every day with kids.
If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m., 2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often, by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space, which is very strange, because it's school, in a way.
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different.
And the other thing was, there was no stigma.
Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help," or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.
And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often, and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.
And so it became a tutoring center -- publishing center, is what we called it -- and a writing center.
They go in, and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.
So there's no stigma.
They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.
These adults, they're working in their field.
They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other.
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem, especially for the adults working at McSweeney's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up, was that there was just the one bathroom.
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention -- they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.
They don't do their homework in front of the TV.
They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family, enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.
And that makes a happy family.
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.
So the key to it all is homework!
There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.
So we started off with about 12 volunteers, and then we had about 50, and then a couple hundred.
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.
The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month, those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder, next to one student, concentrated attention, shining this beam of light on their work, on their thoughts and their self-expression, is going to be absolutely transformative, because so many of the students have not had that ever before.
So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months, it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."
So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.
Then we said, "Well, what are we going to do with the space during the day, because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"
So we started bringing in classes during the day.
So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book -- you can see it being typed up above.
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.
You just point a camera at a class, and it always looks like this.
So this is one of the books that they do.
Notice the title of the book, "The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."
And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic."
So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up, taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.
So then we still had more tutors to use.
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.
The teachers that we work with -- and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.
We went in there thinking, "We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.
The neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.
The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful."
So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?
Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you, necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in, or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying, "Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say, "I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.
We're working on our college essays. Send them in."
So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.
Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.
The teacher tells them what to do, how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.
They work under the teacher's guide, and it's all in one big room.
And that's actually the brunt of what we do is, people going straight from their workplace, straight from home, straight into the classroom and working directly with the students.
So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.
Then another school said, "Well, what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"
So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room, where we decorated it in buccaneer style.
It's right off the library. And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school.
This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News," that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages -- English and Spanish.
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said, "Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."
And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School, which is a school that we had worked with on some other things, and we gave that assignment to the students.
And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.
She's going to publish them in a book.
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."
So these kids worked harder than they've ever worked on anything in their lives, because there was that outside audience, there was Isabel Allende on the other end.
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well.
We had a big party at the end.
This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one, "I Might Get Somewhere."
And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.
Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.
The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life if they know it's going to be permanent, know it's going to be on a shelf, know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said, that we've honored their words, honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts -- all this attention that we give to their thoughts.
And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level, they can never go back.
It's absolutely transformative.
And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.
We sell all the student books.
Where else would you put them, right?
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening with the stores. The store, actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.
So it was paying the rent.
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing -- I don't know, I don't want to judge.
But people would come in -- and this was before the pirate movies and everything!
It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money, but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.
There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.
And it became a gateway to the community.
People would come in and say, "What the --?
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web.
Is that a rule? I don't know.
They would say, "What is this?"
And people would come in and learn more about it.
And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there -- right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.
This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping, and they might be more likely to buy some lard, or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook, or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.
So the store actually did really well.
But it brought in so many people -- teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody -- because it was street level. It was open to the public.
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said, "Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"
And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators, so they combined with a lot of local designers, local writers, and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing.
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.
They didn't think that that was going to work there.
So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York, they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith's shops that has to have every service they've ever offered, you know, all over there.
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.
These are all handmade.
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.
So then you have the villain containment unit, where kids put their parents. You have the office.
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there, it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism, which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.
Personally, I think it's a problem.
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.
These are some of the products. These are all handmade.
This is a secret identity kit.
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone, one American female marketing executive from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape, and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action.
There's nothing worse than, you know, getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.
So then, the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in, but it slowly opens.
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.
It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back.
So you can see the full effect!
But this is -- I just want to emphasize -- locally funded, locally built.
All the designers, all of the builders, everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.
I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great," or whatever. That was it. You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back.
So this is the space during tutoring hours.
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention, complete devotion to the students' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas.
And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?
So it's school, but it's not school.
It's clearly not school, even though they're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.
This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.
You can read this quote.
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.
Came in. Got this concentrated attention.
And he couldn't escape it.
So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early -- got really addicted to finishing his homework early.
It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it, and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.
So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.
He's now been published in five books.
He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called "Super-Has-Beens."
He wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa," which is a fighting -- a boxing -- penguin.
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space, at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.
He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.
There's four family members that come in every day.
So, I'll go through really quickly.
This is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart: "Whenever You Are, We're Already Then."
This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.
So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.
Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine: "Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday."
Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us, doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts; Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California, which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis; Austin Bat Cave in Austin; Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle, this will be open in April.
Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay?
All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish: I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual and organization you know -- will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved, so that within a year we have a thousand examples -- a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships.
Profound leaps forward!
And these can be things that maybe you're already doing.
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things.
I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.
We created a website.
I'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope: We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools.
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community.
Always let the teachers lead the way.
They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.
There are a million ways.
You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.
So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco, they did this phenomenal job.
This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories, a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School," which is a great title, I think.
This site will document every story, every project that comes out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website, you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started.
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.
If you have any questions, you can ask this guy, who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.
You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.
And he'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change.
And it can be fun! That's the point of this talk -- it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.
You can do and use the skills that you have.
The schools need you. The teachers need you.
Students and parents need you. They need your actual person: your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion, sitting next to them, listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time.
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are: how smart and how much they have to say.
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them, one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.
Thank you so much.

<title>Paul Root Wolpe: It's time to question bio-engineering</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Glowing dogs ... mice that grow human ears ... bioethicist Paul Root Wolpe describes an astonishing series of recent bio-engineering experiments, and asks: Isn't it time to set some ground rules?</description>
Today I want to talk about design, but not design as we usually think about it.
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific, biotechnological culture, where, for really the first time in history, we have the power to design bodies, to design animal bodies, to design human bodies.
In the history of our planet, there have been three great waves of evolution.
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.
So, as you all know, species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments, and the pressures of those environments selected which changes, through random mutation in species, were going to be preserved.
Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution, which was we changed the environment in which we evolved.
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization.
And that has been the second great -- couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years -- flow of our evolution.
By changing our environment, we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve.
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities, all the way through modern medicine, we have changed our own evolution.
Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history, which has been called many things: "intentional evolution," "evolution by design" -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change.
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.
We started selectively breeding animals many, many thousands of years ago.
And if you think of dogs for example, dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like.
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them.
We don't have to do it that way anymore.
This is a beefalo.
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.
And they are now making them, and someday, perhaps pretty soon, you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket.
This is a geep, a goat-sheep hybrid.
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.
I think they said it tasted like chicken.
This is a cama.
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid, created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama.
And they are now using these in certain cultures.
Then there's the liger.
This is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid.
It's bigger than a tiger.
And in the case of the liger, there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.
But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology.
And then finally, everybody's favorite, the zorse.
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.
And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement, or genetic manipulation, of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics.
And if that were all this was about, then it would be an interesting thing.
But something much, much more powerful is happening now.
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene, and put it into mammal cells.
These are normal cells.
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light.
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.
So they did it with mouse pups, kittens.
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral, while this is from jellyfish.
They did it with pigs.
They did it with puppies.
And, in fact, they did it with monkeys.
And if you can do it with monkeys -- though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -- if they can do it in monkeys, they can probably figure out how to do it in apes, which means they can do it in human beings.
In other words, it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark.
Be easier to find us at night.
And in fact, right now in many states, you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.
These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow, green, red, and they are actually available now in certain states.
Other states have banned them.
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA -- that controls genetically-engineered pets.
And so some states have decided to allow them, some states have decided to ban them.
Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon.
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed.
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish -- it'll be sold in the stores.
And before you get too worried about it, here in the United States, the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it.
So even as we worry about it, we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe -- without any regulation, and even without any identification on the package.
These are all the first cloned animals of their type.
So in the lower right here, you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh; Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat; CC the cat, for cloned cat; Snuppy, the first cloned dog -- Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy -- created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.
He actually was the first person to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do, because dog genomes are very plastic.
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy, a real "gold ring" of cloning, because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings.
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed.
But if you can clone that horse, you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud.
These were the first cloned calves, the first cloned grey wolves, and then, finally, the first cloned piglets: Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.
In addition, we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species.
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create.
So with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create.
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs, from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea, are pigs that they are going to use, in fact, to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them, instead of producing them in an industrial way.
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species.
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.
A somatic cell, a body cell, was taken from its body, gestated in the ovum of a cow, and then that cow gave birth to a guar.
Same thing happened with the mouflon, where it's an endangered species of sheep.
It was gestated in a regular sheep body, which actually raises an interesting biological problem.
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.
We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA, but we also have DNA in our mitochondria, which are the energy packets of the cell.
That DNA is passed down through our mothers.
So really, what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon, but a guar with cow mitochondria, and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA, and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA.
These are really hybrids, not pure animals.
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve.
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach.
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball.
And now, using a joystick, they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right, forwards or backwards.
They've created a kind of insect bot, or bugbot.
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.
This actually is one of DARPA's very important -- DARPA is the Defense Research Agency -- one of their projects.
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings.
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs, and they can fly these creatures around the lab.
They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.
They can't actually make them land.
They put them about one inch above the ground, and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired.
The wires are already in its body, and they can just hook it up to their technology, and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance.
They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones.
It's not just insects.
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.
Again, it's got technology -- it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres; it's got a camera on top of its head.
The scientists can make this creature go left, right.
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.
They've now created an organic robot.
The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said, "Is this ethical?
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal."
I'll get back to that in a minute.
There's also been work done with monkeys.
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.
He took owl monkeys, wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved, especially looking at the movement of their right arm.
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways.
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm, which you see here in the picture, put the arm in another room.
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves, to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did.
Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm, and the monkey got fascinated.
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm, this prosthetic arm would do.
And eventually she was moving it and moving it, and eventually stopped moving her right arm and, staring at the screen, could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves -- which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms.
And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals.
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip.
They self-aggregated into a network, became an integrated chip.
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.
So now we have organic computer chips made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact, independent lamprey eel brain.
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.
It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides, attached photosensitive sensors to the brain, put it into a cart -- here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart, when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart, the cart moves toward the light; when you turn it off, it moves away.
It's photophilic.
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain.
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts, sitting there in its nutrient medium?
I don't know, but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding.
So, we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes.
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts.
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being.
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation.
This is where we are in this process.
Finally, not that long ago, Craig Venter created the first artificial cell, where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer, which is a machine, created an artificial genome, put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell.
In other words, that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent.
And so, asks The Economist: "The first artificial organism and its consequences."
So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that.
But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.
This is a DNA synthesizer, and here at the bottom are just bottles of A, T, C and G -- the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain.
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.
For the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms.
We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power, and it confers on us a responsibility.
Is everything okay?
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want?
Do we have free reign to design animals?
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog.
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund, the body of a retriever, maybe some pink fur, and let's make it glow in the dark"?
Does industry get to create creatures who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva and other bodily fluids, create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines?
Do we get to create organic robots, where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings?
And then the final step of this, once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings, what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then?
It's already happening. It's not science fiction.
We are not only already using these things in animals, some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies.
We are now taking control of our own evolution.
We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet.
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now.
It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future.
Thanks.

<title>Péter Fankhauser: Meet Rezero, the dancing ballbot</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Engineering student Péter Fankhauser demonstrates Rezero, a robot that balances on a ball. Designed and built by students, Rezero is the first ballbot made to move quickly and gracefully -- and even dance. </description>
Let me introduce to you Rezero.
This little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH-Zurich.
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots.
Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball.
The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground.
This means that the robot is inherently unstable.
It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot.
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable?
Now we'll explain that in a second.
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance.
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately.
This happens 160 times per second, and if anything fails in this process, Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.
Now to move and to balance, Rezero needs to turn the ball.
The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time.
Due to his instability, Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick.
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [dynamically].
Let's play a little.
You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push.
In this mode, he's trying to maintain his position.
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael, on the computer, and Thomas who's helping me onstage.
In the next mode, Rezero is passive, and we can move him around.
With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity.
I can also make him spin.
In the next mode, we can get Rezero to follow a person.
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.
This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero.
With the same method, we can also get him to circle a person.
We call this the orbiting mode.
All right, thank you, Thomas.
Now, what's the use of this technology?
For now, it's an experiment, but let me show you some possible future applications.
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.
With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way.
In a hospital, this device could be used to carry around medical equipment.
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around.
And of course, who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these.
And these are more practical applications.
But there's also a certain beauty within this technology.
Thank you.

<title>Deborah Rhodes: A test that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it's not available to you</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Working with a team of physicists, Dr. Deborah Rhodes developed a new tool for tumor detection that's 3 times as effective as traditional mammograms for women with dense breast tissue. The life-saving implications are stunning. So why haven't we heard of it? Rhodes shares the story behind the tool's creation, and the web of politics and economics that keep it from mainstream use.</description>
There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.
Do you know which group you're in?
If you don't, you're not alone.
Because the breast has become are very political organ.
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies.
I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth.
But first, my disclosures.
I am not a breast cancer survivor.
I'm not a radiologist.
I don't have any patents, and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company, and I am not seeking your vote.
What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question.
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump.
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s.
She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be.
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.
But she asked me a question: how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one?
So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin.
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s.
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force, even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies.
It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage.
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines.
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post.
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest.
But in my view, the radiologists are heroes.
There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms, and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret, and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause.
But that very fact is telling.
Where there is this much legal smoke, there is likely to be some fire.
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density.
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat -- pictured here in yellow -- versus connective and epithelial tissues -- pictured in pink.
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined.
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.
And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause.
So how do you know if your breasts are dense?
Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report.
Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense, that's called fatty-replaced.
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities, followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense.
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense.
The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.
Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram, and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.
So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast.
But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast.
That's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.
Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer, but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer.
It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.
At the time my patient posed this question to me, breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature, and very few women having mammograms, or the physicians ordering them, knew about this.
But what else could I offer her?
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little.
There have been surprisingly few innovations, until digital mammography was approved in 2000.
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera.
The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment?
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women.
But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent.
So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind.
What about ultrasound?
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used.
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive.
If we think about disruptive technology, we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.
Think about iPods compared to stereos.
But it's the exact opposite in health care.
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive.
Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.
It's just way too much equipment.
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price.
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius.
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about.
It's like the essence of TED.
He quotes one innovator who says, "The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick."
This makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions.
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems.
Now, take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article, and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers.
So if you will allow me a little creative license, I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution.
Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with.
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast.
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors.
But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density.
But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases.
But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it.
It's made not of a bulky tube, but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector.
And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density, and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors.
So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.
This is an image from our first patient.
And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise.
But using our new detector, we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.
So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape.
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system.
This is our current detector.
And you can see that it looks a lot different.
The duct tape is gone, and we added a second detector on top of the breast, which has further improved our tumor detection.
So how does this work?
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells, but not by normal cells, and this is the key difference from mammography.
Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast.
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.
After the injection, the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.
And if you've ever had a mammogram -- if you're old enough to have had a mammogram -- you know what comes next: pain.
You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study.
But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression.
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer.
So here's an example.
You can see, on the right, a mammogram showing a faint tumor, the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor, we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors -- one is small as three millimeters.
Our big break came in 2004.
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors, we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts, comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.
Of the tumors that we found, mammography found MBI found 83 percent.
Here's an example from that screening study.
The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue, but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake, which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.
And in this case, a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo, who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young, wanted to enroll in our study.
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue, but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake, which we can also see on a color image.
And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball.
But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes.
So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem.
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose, and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this.
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram.
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.
It's also older women with dense tissue.
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology.
MBI generates four images per breast.
MRI generates over a thousand.
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding.
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image.
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost.
But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo.
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals.
After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology.
Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology.
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose, and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions, and this could take five or more years.
If this technology is widely adopted, I will not benefit financially in any way, and that is very important to me, because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.
But I recognize -- I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science.
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved, but it's not yet widely available.
So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself.
First, know your density.
Ninety percent of women don't, and 95 percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk.
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram.
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is.
Of course we should.
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report.
Second, if you're pre-menopausal, try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle, when breast density is relatively lower.
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging.
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.
Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer.
But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation.
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive.
So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer.
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim.
It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations.
We need to individualize screening based on density.
For women without dense breasts, mammography is the best choice.
But for women with dense breasts; we shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better.
The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school, and the answer has been so slow to come.
She's given me her blessing to share this story with you.
After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer, she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy.
We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you.
Thank you.

<title>Raspyni Brothers: Juggle and jest</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Illustrious jugglers the Raspyni Brothers show off their uncanny balance, agility, coordination and willingness to sacrifice . Now, if you'll just stand completely still...</description>
Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show; it's something we just kind of learned for this, so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
Nice show. Man, that was good!
DH: Thank you.
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
You actually just did that.
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...
DH: All right, let's show them something special.
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on.
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.
DH: A type of juggling I actually invented, right after I saw another juggler do it.
BF: Shut up.
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down.
BF: Oh yeah, it does.
BF: Oh, Daniel.
DH: One more?
Perfect.
Perfect.
BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.
I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.
BF: Also three with his left.
DH: Perfect.
And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose?
BF: First try? Once on purpose?
DH: How about if I try first and then decide?
BF: Good idea. Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.
DH: He's looking at me.
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.
DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help.
Oh, good. All right.
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
And then we thought, "How stupid."
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?
BF: I think that's the next session.
DH: Next session?
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.
DH: Please stand up, Richard.
DH: Now Richard, please ...
BF: OK, sorry.
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.
Richard Wurman: Can I say something?
BF: Sure.
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
DH: All right, please stand here in front ...
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.
BF: No, come stay up with him.
Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
It's kind of neat. OK.
DH: Wow, you've been working out.
BF: No, shut up!
Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.
OK, here we go.
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
There you go.
OK.
OK, hold on.
RW: Hmmm.
DH: First one.
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?
What happened there?
BF: I think we were just outside.
DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it.
DH: One more, one more.
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.
RW: Do I get to hold them?
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.
One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.
Could you just push that?
DH: Wow! Boy!
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.
DH: Let's jump this way, though.
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...
DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.
DH: True. Barry ...
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.
DH: Leap over my shoulder.
BF: Up and over his shoulders.
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...
Still juggling.
Impossible, you say?
BF: Incredible, you say?
DH: Why bother, you say?
BF: Here we go.
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?
BF: This guy, this guy invented air.
DH: I think so, that's right.
Even the pencil.
BF: He invented the pencil.
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect.
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.
Actually, we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage?
Or a virgin for a sacrifice?
BF: Anything?
DH: Where's Gloria?
BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.
DH: Do you have a small farm animal?
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.
BF: Over the top, over the top.
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
BF: Yeah, it's all right.
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...
BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.
DH: Everything up here's OK?
BF: Yeah.
DH: Then here we go.
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs? Is that possible? I can still see a little.
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
We went too far.
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
The design of the body is a whole different thing.
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
DH: May we have our jumping music please?
May we have it a bit louder?
BF: They're a good crew! Whoa!
DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.
BF: We're going on.
DH: All right, we'll try again.
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.
DH: Whenever you're ready.
BF: There we go!
All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
Somebody dance! Come on!
Wow, wow, OK, stop.
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this.
I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.
DH: The French judge ...
BF: One more quick thing.
DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.
BF: Well, you know ...
DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships.
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition.
DH: That's right.
BF: Good.
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.
BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
And look, it has a twin!
DH: There's still one more by my foot.
What do you want me to do with it?
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year.
DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.
BF: Nice.
DH: I got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.
BF: Nice.
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.
DH: How about that? I'll do it again.
Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.
And it's awfully windy over there.
BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.
DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!
Oh, look how it lies there.
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
Too much Olympics.
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.
DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
What gem of knowledge?
What pearl of wisdom?
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
Is that your final answer?
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
DH: I do, I do.
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
DH: We will juggle seven.
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.
BF: Yes.
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.
Put your tongue away, Barry.

<title>Kevin Stone: The bio-future of joint replacement</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Arthritis and injury grind down millions of joints, but few get the best remedy -- real biological tissue. Kevin Stone shows a treatment that could sidestep the high costs and donor shortfall of human-to-human transplants with a novel use of animal tissue.</description>
So let me just start with my story.
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college.
Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee, and then developed an arthritic knee.
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story, and, by the way, I married a woman who has exactly the same story.
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.
So with that, let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.
Narrator: We are all aware of the risk of cancer, but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers, arthritis ruins more lives.
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance you'll develop arthritis.
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis.
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain, until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.
Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts, but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body, shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?
Let's consider an alternative path.
What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature, or within our own stem cells?
This is the field of biologic replacements, where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.
Kevin Stone: And so, the mission is: how do I treat these things biologically?
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife, and what I've done for hundreds of other patients.
First thing for my wife, and the most common thing I hear from my patients, particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group, is they come in and say, "Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?
I'm not ready for joint replacement."
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [knee] joint space.
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].
And then for that unstable ligament, we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee.
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface, we did a stem cell paste graft, which we designed in 1991, to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there.
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left, and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen, and doing well.
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak, just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee, as you see in the other image -- and having a paste graft to that knee.
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.
So with all this success, why isn't that good enough, you might ask.
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.
There's not enough young, healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us.
And the tissue's very expensive.
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.
But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful, it's cheap, you can get it from young, healthy tissues, but the barrier is immunology.
And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl, or gal epitope.
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people, we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984.
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon, where we would take the cow Achilles tendon, which is type-I collagen, strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template.
We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee.
We've now done that procedure, and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases, so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus.
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue.
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?
I can't grind it up in a blender.
So in that case, I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -- an enzyme wash to wash away, or strip, those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme.
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.
What we do is humanize the tissue.
It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it , and then we can put it back into a patient's knee.
And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament -- young, healthy, big tissue, put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial -- and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships -- on his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.
So what about the next step?
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement, not just the parts?
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?
Well here's how we're going to do it.
So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young, healthy pig, strip it of its antigens, load it with your stem cells, then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee, tack it on there, have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.
So that's our biologic approach right now.
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.
There's a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation.
We can harness those benefits.
We can use thicker, younger, better tissues than you might have injured in your knee, or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.
We can do it as an outpatient procedure.
We can strip that tissue very economically, and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global.
And so welcome to super biologics.
It's not hardware.
It's not software.
It's bioware.
It's version 2.0 of you.
And so with that, coming to a -- coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.
Thank you very much.

<title>Marcel Dicke: Why not eat insects?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Marcel Dicke makes an appetizing case for adding insects to everyone's diet. His message to squeamish chefs and foodies: delicacies like locusts and caterpillars compete with meat in flavor, nutrition and eco-friendliness.</description>
Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets.
And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects?
That's quite a lot.
But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth.
Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.
But this is quite good.
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.
And here you see just a selection.
There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species.
There's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects.
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers.
In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs.
But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth.
That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects.
Insects are not only there in nature, but they also are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing.
There was an estimation, a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year.
It's a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.
And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year.
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.
Well we know that that was not a cheap war.
So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing.
And not only in the States, but in any country, in any economy.
What do they do?
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.
They control pests, and they're food for animals.
They're at the start of food chains.
Small animals eat insects.
Even larger animals eat insects.
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals.
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.
And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants.
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat.
And they prepare it in a wonderful way.
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars, locusts, bee pupae -- delicacies.
And you can eat something new everyday.
There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe.
That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep.
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety.
And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.
Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception.
You're eating at least 500 grams per year.
What are you eating?
Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles -- any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops.
Some fruits get some insect damage.
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup.
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.
And that's your view of a tomato.
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup, and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency, there can be all kinds of things in there, no problem.
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway?
In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of.
So anything is a good protein source already.
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."
We're even doing this on purpose.
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye.
The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal.
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti.
It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business.
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros.
One gram of gold is 30 euros.
So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods.
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially.
Where, at the moment, we have something between six and seven billion people, it will grow to about nine billion in 2050.
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people.
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this.
How are we going to feed this world?
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent.
And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat.
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game.
And we eat quite a lot of it.
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year.
In the developing world it's much lower.
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.
But it's increasing enormously.
In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing.
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat.
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them.
They have the same share that we have.
Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world.
We could do with much, much less -- and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time, and you can easily do without anything.
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.
But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production, and we're being faced with that more and more often.
The first problem that we're facing is human health.
Pigs are quite like us.
They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.
That means that pigs also share diseases with us.
And a pig disease, a pig virus, and a human virus can both proliferate, and because of their kind of reproduction, they can combine and produce a new virus.
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak.
You get a new disease that can be deadly.
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen.
So that's one point for insects.
And there's the conversion factor.
You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.
So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do?
With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output.
So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output.
We're not taking the bonus yet.
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.
So that's two points for insects.
And there's the environment.
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure.
If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce.
So less waste.
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure.
So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung.
So that's three points for insects.
Now there's a big "if," of course, and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality.
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good.
In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment.
And even in terms of calories, it is very good.
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.
So that's four points for insects.
I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this.
So the question is, why not eat insects?
I gave you at least four arguments in favor.
We'll have to.
Even if you don't like it, you'll have to get used to this because at the moment, 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock.
That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported.
We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests, but there's a limitation very soon.
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way.
We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects.
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere.
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.
So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy.
It's just very good food.
You can vary enormously.
It has many benefits.
In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price.
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?
There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related.
They are delicacies.
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet.
So why are we not eating insects yet?
Well that's just a matter of mindset.
We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.
That's why we're changing the perception of insects.
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis, in telling people what insects are, what magnificent things they are, what magnificent jobs they do in nature.
And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well.
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.
And some might think, well they're not yet available.
Well they are.
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them, and one of them is here in the audience, Marian Peeters, who's in the picture.
I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible, but as animal protein in the food.
And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways.
A Dutch chocolate maker.
So there's even a lot of design to it.
Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry.
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
over to the Hague recently, she went to a high-class restaurant, and they ate insects all together.
It's not something that is a hobby of mine.
It's really taken off the ground.
So why not eat insects?
You should try it yourself.
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news.
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing.
So you can try it yourself today, and I would say, enjoy.
And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries, and he can have the first bite.
Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.
Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.
BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.
And it looks delicious.
They just make it [with] nuts or something.
MD: Thank you.

<title>Lawrence Lessig: Re-examining the remix</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Former "young Republican" Larry Lessig talks about what Democrats can learn about copyright from their opposite party, considered more conservative. A surprising lens on remix culture.</description>
I want to talk about what we learn from conservatives.
And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days, so I want to confess to you that when I was a kid, indeed, I was a conservative.
I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican, a leader in the Teenage Republicans.
Indeed, I was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan to be the Republican nominee for president.
Now, I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."
You're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."
And indeed, this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these Internets here.
Wikipedia reports that this guy, this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people at the Republican National Convention, but it's just not true.
Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.
All right. Okay, so ... perfect.
Perfect.
Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.
Okay.
Finally, truth will be brought here.
Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.
That's it. Please save this.
Great, here we go.
And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.
But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives -- not so much this issue of the 1980 convention -- the thing to think about is this: They go to church.
Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.
I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.
And I'm not talking about the God thing.
I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.
They go to church, by which I mean, they do lots of things for free for each other.
They hold potluck dinners.
Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.
They serve food to poor people.
They share, they give, they give away for free.
And it's the very same people leading Wall Street firms who, on Sundays, show up and share.
And not only food, right.
These very same people are strong believers, in lots of contexts, in the limits on the markets.
They are in many important places against markets.
Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.
But they're very keen that we don't let money drop into that relationship, else it turns into something like this.
They want to regulate us, those conservatives, to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.
Because they understand: There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist, where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others.
They recognize: Both of these things have to live together.
And the second great thing about conservatives: they get ecology.
Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century who taught us about environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.
They first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources.
And then they began to teach us in the context of innovation, economics.
They understand, in that context, "free." They understand "free" is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well.
That's the thing I want you to think about them.
Now, I know you don't believe me, really, here.
So here's exhibit number one.
I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez, a libertarian who works at the, for many people, "evil" Cato Institute.
Okay, so Julian made this video.
He's a terrible producer of videos, but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.
So here he is beginning.
Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ...
Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos.
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania.
Which, of course, spread virally.
Hugely successful.
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.
They decided they wanted to do the same.
And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.
And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.
And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.
Here's lesson number one.
JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.
They are acting in the sense that they're emulating the original mashup.
And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing.
But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together.
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party with a group of good friends.
LL: Or ...
JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here, remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement; it becomes an act of social creativity.
And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end, it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.
All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression.
It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art.
LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
JS: One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
Stage two, social remix, is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other.
First, within each video, the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group.
But there's also a dialogue between the videos, where, once the basic structure is established, it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds.
LL: And then, here's for me, the critical key to what Julian has to say ...
JS: Copyright policy isn't just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity; it's about what level of control we're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities -- social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture.
I think it's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.
If we're only focused on how to maximize the supply of one, I think we risk suppressing this different and richer and, in some ways, maybe even more important one.
LL: Right. Bingo. Point.
Freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture.
And for that to happen, you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected, to enable this kind of innovation, as this libertarian tells us, between these two creative cultures, a commercial and a sharing culture.
The point is they, he, here, gets that culture.
Now, my concern is, we Dems, too often, not so much.
All right, take for example this great company.
In the good old days when this Republican ran that company, their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.
All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them, or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them, to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.
Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course, as "Steamboat Willie," is a remix of the then, very dominant, very popular "Steamboat Bill" by Buster Keaton.
This man was a remixer extraordinaire.
He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity.
But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat.
Wildly different.
This is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, extending the term of existing copyrights by 20 years, so that no one could do to Disney what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.
Now, when we tried to challenge this, going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down, we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right-wing Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman, who said he would join our brief only if the word "no brainer" was in the brief somewhere.
But apparently, no brains existed in this place when Democrats passed and signed this bill into law.
Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote: Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican, but I don't buy it.
This guy is no Republican.
Okay, for a second example, think about this cultural hero, icon on the Left, creator of this character.
Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps, inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.
Read the license.
The license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to Lucas.
The mashup is owned by Lucas.
Indeed, anything you add to the mashup, music you might add, Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free.
There is no creator here to be recognized.
The creator doesn't have any rights.
The creator is a sharecropper in this story.
And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers: the Democrats, right?
So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership, a respect for ownership, the respect we should give the creator, the remixer, the owner, the property owner, the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff, and not a generation of sharecroppers.
Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here, lessons about openness.
Our lives are sharing activities, at least in part.
Even for the head of Goldman Sachs, at least in part.
And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have well-protected spaces of fair use.
That's number one. Number two: This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create.
Freedom, which means without permission from anyone, the ability to create.
And number three: We need to respect the creator, the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them.
Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit Creative Commons.
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit, but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the Creative Commons, which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry.
So that we go from a "all rights reserved" world to a "some rights reserved" world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content, building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work.
These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely.
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses, as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there, licensed freely in this way.
Now that picture of an ecology of creativity, the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity, is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?
Well, as you all know, not many of us believe we do.
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week.
I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given, and I uploaded it to YouTube.
I then got this email from YouTube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious WMG that matched their content ID.
So I didn't think much about it.
And then on Twitter, somebody said to me, "Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"
imagining that I had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.
I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.
But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.
My whole 45-minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video, a video about fair use, that included Warner Music Group music.
Now, interestingly, they still sold ads for that music, if you played the silent video.
You could still buy the music, but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced.
So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use.
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.
And then in an extraordinarily Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way you've actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak.
And I felt like I was in third grade again.
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.
I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."
This is absurd.
It is outrageous.
It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging.
And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election, who was the number one, active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech?
John McCain.
Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system, that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the Internet.
Now, that was the story of me then, my good old days of right-wing lunacy.
Let me come back to now, now when I'm a little leftist -- I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty -- And I wonder, can we on the Left expect to build this ecology of freedom, now, in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it, where even icons of the Left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government-funded research?
The president, who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements, which effectively lock us into the insane system of DMCA that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.
Not a single example of reform has been produced yet.
And we're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon.
So here's the lessons of openness that I think we need to learn.
Openness is a commitment to a certain set of values.
We need to speak of those values.
The value of freedom. It's a value of community.
It's a value of the limits in regulation.
It's a value respecting the creator.
Now, if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right, if we can take them and incorporate them, maybe we could do a little trade.
We learn those values on the Left, and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right.
Anyway, please join me in teaching these values.
Thank you very much.

<title>Chris Bangle: Great cars are great art</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: American designer Chris Bangle explains his philosophy that car design is an art form in its own right, with an entertaining -- and ultimately moving -- account of the BMW Group's Deep Blue project, intended to create the SUV of the future.</description>
What I want to talk about is, as background, is the idea that cars are art.
This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.
This is completely different than automobiles.
Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.
And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways; they've also been a real pain in the ass, because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.
We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion -- but that's not what interests me in this speech.
What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways.
And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles, and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on, and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.
That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it -- your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.
It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy, the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage, you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.
Many people think, "Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that."
Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.
It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.
And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.
That tension between the need to express, the need to discover, then you put something new into it, and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.
Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces; this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.
And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new -- and at the same time, that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship -- that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.
We work in clay, which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it, and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.
Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?
There we go, the automobile.
That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?
Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?
OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here, but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.
I want to talk about this.
Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.
And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.
Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore, I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about -- at least when it comes to cars -- comes right back to this idea of the mean.
It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself, that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.
And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.
We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.
This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it, and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.
And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this, or when somebody works like this.
It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.
Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.
Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.
Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.
We don't really have a problem talking about love.
We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.
That's what we're searching for -- when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.
We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.
However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach.
We're dealing with irrationalisms, and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist, and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing.
We've pretty much accepted the fact, though, that we are the women in the organization at BMW -- BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.
And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK, that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.
We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic; it's really a truth.
And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it, with soul. You know how strong this is.
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word "design" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?
You can understand that. It works in truisms.
"All is fair in design and war."
Certainly we live in a competitive society.
I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?
Toothbrush, cool.
It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?
This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of.
And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.
But right now it's in dealing with our own people, our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.
The idea of people-work is what we work with here, and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.
We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family; we have to understand ourselves that way.
There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too.
You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.
You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.
That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.
We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?
Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.
And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.
All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery, and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?
And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion, we are completely in love with our own creations.
This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.
This is sick beyond belief.
But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.
We have a shared center; we have a shared focus -- that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.
And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.
I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.
We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars, down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car, and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.
Someone's love, someone's baby.
This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.
They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else.
Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you, because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.
We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it, that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.
So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.
This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.
It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.
So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers, and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget, what we thought was a set of deliverables, a timetable, and nothing else.
Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.
And a group of engineers worked in Germany, and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.
They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart, come together, and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.
Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart, where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off, and actually something different happened. They went other places.
They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.
Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon, and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls, and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.
And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."
Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio, and six or seven apartments, it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.
And -- at least they told me it was her house, I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.
But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.
Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind, and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America, but the first three months were the most intensive.
And one of the young women in the project, she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.
The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating.
On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?
Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?
So my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.
However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.
And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions.
Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was -- these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.
You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all.
And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?
And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel -- who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project -- and they would present their results.
We would see where we were going, we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.
And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.
I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense -- I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together, and I'm going to see some really great product.
So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time.
The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together.
Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.
And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem.
And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, "This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."
And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was, the engineers showed up with nothing.
And the engineers told the designers, "If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out, we'll walk right out of the project."
So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.
There was a whole lot of dialog.
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers.
And here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page, and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches, I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."
Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.
And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff.
I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.
You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.
After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.
I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?
You're letting me down, you're my designers, you're supposed to be the creative ones, what the hell is going on around here?"
It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones, but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money, how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?
Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted, they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything, in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start, because they hadn't realized, of course, that they couldn't do problem creating.
So we went to lunch -- And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.
The engineers all sat at one end of the table, the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.
And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?
Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.
That's what you get furious about right?
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something?
I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
He said, "Love is not selfish," he said, "Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month, and it's two times less than last month, so that means you don't love me as much.
Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought, "You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.
I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.
This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches, and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.
This cannot be."
So I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.
Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'" I said "This can't be."
Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it, because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted, and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.
And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.
We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love, I think, truly back into the center of the process.
By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America.
One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.
It was the rendition of our motorcycle, the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful," as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.
And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you, was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."
There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.
I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day, and it's stayed that way ever since.
And I hope that you too find that there's more to design, and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.
It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.
Thanks so much.

<title>Cameron Sinclair: The refugees of boom-and-bust</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TEDGlobal U, Cameron Sinclair shows the unreported cost of real estate megaprojects gone bust: thousands of migrant construction laborers left stranded and penniless. To his fellow architects, he says there is only one ethical response.</description>
A few years ago, my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry.
In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.
1.1 million of them.
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home.
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water, no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities, 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector, and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged, but the numbers are simply overwhelming.
In August 2008, UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.
And last summer, more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages, for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.
And then the financial collapse happened.
When the contractors have gone bust, as they've been overleveraged like everyone else, the difference is everything goes missing, documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers.
Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.
There is no way back home.
And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.
These are the boom-and-bust refugees.
The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations?
So let's forget your environmental footprint.
Let's think about your ethical footprint.
What good is it to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex, when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best?
Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.
But, quite frankly, on this issue, there is no other road.
So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.
And that as we worry about our next job in the office, the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.
Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.
Thank you.

<title>Tyler DeWitt: Hey science teachers -- make it fun</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria -- and devastated when his students hated it. The problem was the textbook: it was impossible to understand. He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations. </description>
Let me tell you a story.
It's my first year as a new high school science teacher, and I'm so eager.
I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.
But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything.
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack.
And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them, and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool?"
There's silence.
Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye, and she says, "The reading sucked."
And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.
It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks."
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now, and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat, that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook, but not one of them really understood the main ideas.
Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool, why it's so important.
I'm totally clueless.
I have no idea what to do next.
So the only thing I can think of is say, "Listen. Let me tell you a story.
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.
These guys are blown up a couple million times.
The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope, and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick.
But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick."
Now, the story that I start telling my kids, it starts out like a horror story.
Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium.
Don't get too attached to him.
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere, and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch, and then things get really horrible, as his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus coming out from his insides.
And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides.
If -- Ouch is right! -- If you see this, and you're a bacterium, this is like your worst nightmare.
But if you're a virus and you see this, you cross those little legs of yours and you think, "We rock."
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.
Here's what had to happen.
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it.
The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA.
And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA, the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses.
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make.
So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.
The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions.
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.
But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.
Some are much more crafty.
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium, they do a little espionage.
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell, but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first.
Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA, and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell, waiting for instructions.
And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies, the babies also have the virus DNA in them.
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family, filled with virus sleeper cells.
They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out.
It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories, and they all burst, a huge, extended bacteria family, all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts, the viruses taking over the bacterium.
So now you understand how viruses can attack cells.
There are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way, where the viruses go right in and take over the cells.
On the [right] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses.
So this stuff is not that hard, right?
And now all of you understand it.
But if you've graduated from high school, I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.
But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.
So when my students were first learning this, why did they hate it so much?
Well, there were a couple of reasons.
First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories.
You know, in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness.
It kills me. I'm not kidding.
I used to work for an educational publisher, and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories or fun, engaging language, because then my work might not be viewed as "serious" and "scientific."
Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science.
So we have this field of science that's all about slime, and color changes. Check this out.
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have, explosions!
But if a textbook seems too much fun, it's somehow unscientific.
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier, we could start by saying something like, "These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."
The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this: "Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium."
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.
But here's the thing. There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students, because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA.
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.
They have something called RNA instead.
So a professional science writer would circle that and say, "That has to go.
We have to change it to something much more technical."
And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation, they'd find fault with almost every word I've used, and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough, and they'd have to change everything that wasn't 100 percent perfect.
Then it would be accurate, but it would be completely impossible to understand.
This is horrifying.
You know, I keep talking about this idea of telling a story, and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision, where you can't just tell a story.
It's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about, where you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day, and she was wearing these ugly jeans.
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think — " and you're just like, "Oh my God.
What is the point?"
Or even worse, science education is becoming like that guy who always says, "Actually."
Right? You want to be like, "Oh, dude, we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness."
And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles."
And you're like, "Actually, shut up!
I'm just trying to tell a story."
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection.
We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters.
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across.
I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said, and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth.
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education.
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science.
That's not true at all.
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT, and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed, specific scientific communication between experts, but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA, that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.
But if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this, that will ruin their chances of success.
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.
But I think that's unlikely.
So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up.
There's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple, understandable ways.
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand.
And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube.
I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances, and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp.
The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in LOLcats, but nonetheless it's so appreciative, so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science.
There's still so much work left to be done, though, and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me.
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.
Make me laugh. Make me care.
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point.
How should you start?
Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"?
Thank you.

<title>Kevin Surace: Eco-friendly drywall</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Kevin Surace suggests we rethink basic construction materials -- such as the familiar wallboard -- to reduce the huge carbon footprint generated by the manufacturing and construction of our buildings. He introduces EcoRock, a clean, recyclable and energy-efficient drywall created by his team at Serious Materials.</description>
What's happening to the climate?
It is unbelievably bad.
This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic, which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.
So we all look at what we can do.
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2, 52 percent are tied to buildings.
Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.
So we ran off to a sushi bar.
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.
And it was something called EcoRock.
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.
So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent, which is exactly what we've done.
We started R&amp;D in 2006.
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing.
There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.
But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.
And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.
So then we went forward and built our production line in China.
We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.
We did the line install over the summer.
We started right there, with absolutely nothing.
You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line, not made using gypsum at all.
That's the finished production line there.
We got our first panel out on December third.
That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.
The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.
These are people who worked this project for two to three years.
And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited.
But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony, leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.
And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.
Thank you. Thank you.
So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house.
You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.
We must change everything.
Look around the room: chairs, wood, everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.
Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.
And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.
We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.
We're going as fast as we can.
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum, you know, CO2 generated. Right?
So what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up.
Those are my kids, Natalie and David.
When they have their kids, 2050, they'd better look back at Grandpa and say, "Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could with the team that you had."
So my hope is that when you leave TED, you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it.
And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you.
Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.
Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.
Thank you so much.

<title>Shigeru Ban: Emergency shelters made from paper</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Long before sustainability was a buzzword, Pritzker Prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban had begun his experiments with ecologically sound building materials such as cardboard tubes. His remarkable structures are often intended as temporary housing for disaster-struck nations such as Haiti, Rwanda, Japan. Yet often the buildings remain a beloved part of the landscape long after they have served their intended purpose. </description>
Hi. I am an architect.
I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube, and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes.
1986, much, much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues, I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure.
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building, but this is much stronger than I expected, and also it's very easy to waterproof, and also, because it's industrial material, it's also possible to fireproof.
Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.
This is the first temporary building made out of paper.
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters], there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.
As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.
In case you're finished with toilet paper, you can tear off the inside of the wall.
So it's very useful.
Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.
I was asked to design the building, because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes, recyclable paper.
My goal of the design is not when it's completed.
My goal was when the building was demolished, because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste, so my building has to be reused or recycled.
After, the building was recycled.
So that was the goal of my design.
Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz.
Because I was so poor, I wanted to rent an office in Paris, but I couldn't afford it, so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves.
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office.
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.
Thank you. I had one big problem.
Because we were part of the exhibition, even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.
That was the problem.
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.
It's a very popular museum now, and I created a big monument for the government.
But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect, because we are not helping, we are not working for society, but we are working for privileged people, rich people, government, developers.
They have money and power.
Those are invisible.
So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture.
That is our profession, even historically it's the same, even now we are doing the same.
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society, even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters.
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.
For example, earthquakes never kill people, but collapse of the buildings kill people.
That's the responsibility of architects.
Then people need some temporary housing, but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people.
So I thought, even as architects, we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.
We can make it better.
So that is why I started working in disaster areas.
1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.
Over two million people became refugees.
But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp organized by the U.N.
They're so poor, and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season, In the shelters built by the U.N., they were just providing a plastic sheet, and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.
But over two million people cut trees.
It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem.
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.
Very expensive, they throw them out for money, then cutting trees again.
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong, but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.
And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan, we had a big earthquake.
Nearly 7,000 people were killed, and the city like this Nagata district, all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.
And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church -- all the building was totally destroyed.
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests, "Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"
And he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?
After a fire, what are you proposing?"
So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.
I started commuting to Kobe, and I met the society of Vietnamese people.
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park.
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.
I made a paper tube shelter for them, and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish, I used beer crates as a foundation.
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose, because at that time, the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red, which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.
The color coordination is very important.
And also I still remember, we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate, but it came empty.
So I remember it was so disappointing.
So during the summer with my students, we built over 50 units of the shelters.
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.
He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself, bring your students to build, you can do it."
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake, and we proposed to donate this church, so we dismantled them, we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.
So this building became a permanent building.
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?
Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it.
Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money.
In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake, I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.
And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China, nearly 70,000 people were killed, and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.
In one month, we completed nine classrooms, over 500 square meters.
It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.
And this is a very interesting photo: former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso -- you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.
And they are very kind, affording my model.
I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall, because L'Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed, so musicians were moving out.
So I proposed to the mayor, I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.
He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it."
And I was very lucky.
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit, and our former prime minister came, so they helped us to collect money, and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium.
Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake, but it's impossible to fly over, so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country, to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.
This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.
After the earthquake and tsunami, people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.
But look at this. There's no privacy.
People suffer mentally and physically.
So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes, just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.
However, some of the facility authority doesn't want us to do it, because, they said, simply, it's become more difficult to control them.
But it's really necessary to do it.
They don't have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one.
Look at this. Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing, so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking, so I thought, we have to make multi-story building because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi.
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].
I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable, within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same, but much more comfortable.
Many of the people want to stay here forever.
I was very happy to hear that.
Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened, also they had a big earthquake, and many Japanese students were also killed, and the most important cathedral of the city, the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.
So this is under construction.
And I'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

<title>Zeresenay Alemseged: The search for humanity's roots</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Paleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged looks for the roots of humanity in Ethiopia's badlands. Here he talks about finding the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child -- and how Africa holds the clues to our humanity.</description>
I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years.
All right.
We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.
And I say that not because I am African, but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors, upright walking traces, even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.
So we all are Africans, and welcome home.
All right.
I'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define man's place in nature and explore what makes us human.
And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered, to tell you a story of all of us.
Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.
She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.
You don't need to remember that.
That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.
We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance, I think.
After I was invited by TED, I did some digging, because that's what we do, to know about my host.
You don't just jump into an invitation.
And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.
And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads.
And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.
I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry.
However, DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end, telling us nothing about what happened in the middle.
So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence, the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development.
Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about -- -- it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times, and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.
That then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today.
But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.
It's a systematic and scientific approach, which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.
Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika, where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500, but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.
I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.
When you get there, this is what you see, and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.
And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.
And you find nothing for years and years.
When I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites, it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.
But what you find are not the human remains, such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.
You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
But you could ask, how could these large mammals live in this desert environment?
Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today.
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.
Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.
And our ancestors lived in that game park, but were just the minorities. They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.
To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity, I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here, and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.
They would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for."
I would say, "No, that's an elephant."
Again, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.
So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.
You either don't know what you're looking for, or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.
And I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions, and the people were scared and went somewhere else.
Let's go somewhere else."
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.
It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam, and you see the face here covered by sandstone.
And here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block, because she was buried by a river.
What you have here seems to be nothing, but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human.
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology, an amazing piece of our long, long history.
There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures, that's why I am not in.
How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand, but you are in the middle of nowhere?
The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement, of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility, of making sure everything is safe.
Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning, preparation and description, which was very long, as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide.
It took five years.
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years, but the labor was very long.
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism, who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child, because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child, even a minister.
So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.
Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.
We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs, the foot, and some features clearly showed that she walked upright, and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.
But in addition, if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here, you see that you have vertical forehead.
And you see that in humans, because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.
You don't see that in chimpanzees, and you don't see this very projecting canine.
So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course, you do detailed analysis, and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species, known as Australopithecus afarensis.
The next exciting question is, girl or boy?
And how old was she when she died?
You can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth.
How?
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism, which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females.
But to do that, you need the permanent dentition, which you don't see here, because what you have here are the baby teeth.
But using the CT scanning technology, which is normally used for medical purposes, you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still-growing adult teeth here.
So when you measure those teeth, it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth.
And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
So, this girl died when she was about three, 3.3 million years ago.
So, with all that information, the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us?
To answer this question, we can phrase another question.
What do we actually know about our ancestors?
We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved, how they walked around, and how they lived and grew up.
And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included: first, this skeleton documents, for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.
And second, she tells us that she walked upright, but had some adaptation for tree climbing.
And more interesting, however, is the brain in this child was still growing.
At age three, if you have a still-growing brain, it's a human behavior.
In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.
That's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth -- faster than us, anyway.
But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.
That's why we need care from our parents.
But that care means also you learn.
You spend more time with your parents.
And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood, which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents.
So, the still-growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood, which requires an incredible social organization, a very complex social organization, emerged over three million years ago.
So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history, Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human.
But not everything was human, and I will give you a very exciting example.
This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.
It supports your tongue from behind.
It's, in a way, your voice box.
It determines the type of voice you produce.
It was not known in the fossil record, and we have it in this skeleton.
When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.
So if you were there 3.3 million years ago, to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother, she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.
Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.
What does that tell us?"
You know, that is very exciting for us, because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively, and that evolution is in the making.
To summarize the significance of this fossil, we can say the following.
Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.
They don't preserve well, as you know.
So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors, on how they looked like, how they behaved, was kind of biased toward adults.
Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies, the children, and he goes back and reports.
Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?
That's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children, so I think the new fossil fixes this problem.
So, I think the most important question at the end is, what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general?
Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human, you know, the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications that we, Homo sapiens, have today.
But if this species, ancient species, would travel in time and see us today, they would very much be very proud of their legacy, because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe.
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy, but they did great.
Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.
So the question is, are we up to the challenge?
And can we really do better than these primitive, small-brained ancestors?
Among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.
Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people to talk about this.
Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.
One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa, carrying guns, that depends on other people forever, or to promote an Africa which is confident, peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time.
I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.
And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.
That's because we Africans concentrate -- I am from Ethiopia, by the way -- we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere, or from outside.
I think it's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves.
That's what I call positive African attitude.
So finally, I would like to say, so let's help Africa walk upright and forward, then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.
Thank you.

<title>Neil Burgess: How your brain tells you where you are</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How do you remember where you parked your car? How do you know if you're moving in the right direction? Neuroscientist Neil Burgess studies the neural mechanisms that map the space around us, and how they link to memory and imagination.</description>
When we park in a big parking lot, how do we remember where we parked our car?
Here's the problem facing Homer.
And we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain.
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow, which is the organ of memory.
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's, you can't remember things including where you parked your car.
It's named after Latin for "seahorse," which it resembles.
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.
So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it.
And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells, which are very densely interconnected.
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.
And when it fires a little spike of electricity, there's going to be a red dot and a click.
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike.
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal's location.
And if we record from lots of different neurons, we'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment, like in this square box shown here.
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain, telling the brain continually, "Where am I now within my environment?"
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.
So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.
And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town.
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active, start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment?
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important.
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in.
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
The one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south.
And if you put another wall inside the box, then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box.
So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus.
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus, cells are found which project into the hippocampus, which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around.
So the cell on the left, you can see, it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east, whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
We can also test where we think objects are, like this goal flag, in simple environments -- or indeed, where your car would be.
So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember.
And then, if we put them back in the environment, generally they're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was.
But on some trials, we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell.
In that case, we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
And what you see, for example, if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment, and then if you ask people where it was, but you've made the environment bigger, where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out.
It's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location, and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern.
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
But we also know where we are through movement.
So if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements, which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back.
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell.
Now grid cells are found, again, on the inputs to the hippocampus, and they're a bit like place cells.
But now as the rat explores around, each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid.
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment, and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells.
So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
So together, it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map, but using triangles.
And as it moves around, the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is, so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment.
Do people have grid cells?
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal.
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex, which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
So back to Homer.
He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked.
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park, which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire.
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there.
Maybe it's been towed.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
So beyond spatial memory, if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain, we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks, like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least, of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
So if this was happening, your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint.
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
Another kind of cell, head direction cells, which I didn't mention yet, they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery, so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
Thank you very much.

<title>Nigel Marsh: How to make work-life balance work</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Work-life balance, says Nigel Marsh, is too important to be left in the hands of your employer. Marsh lays out an ideal day balanced between family time, personal time and productivity -- and offers some stirring encouragement to make it happen.</description>
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request.
I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings, and take stock of your miserable existence.
Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century.
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40.
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior -- I was eating too much, I was drinking too much, I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family.
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around.
In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance.
So I stepped back from the workforce, and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children.
But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work.
Not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out.
So I went back to work, and I've spent these seven years since struggling with, studying and writing about work-life balance.
And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today.
The first is: if society's to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate.
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance.
All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue, which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family.
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.
And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like.
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.
The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us.
We should stop looking outside.
It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead.
If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you, and you may just not like their idea of balance.
It's particularly important -- this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired -- it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation.
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.
I'm talking about all companies.
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [as] they can get away with.
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA; it's what they do -- even the good, well-intentioned companies.
On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened.
On the other hand, it's a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life.
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance.
Before I went back to work after my year at home, I sat down and I wrote out a detailed, step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to.
And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep.
Have sex.
Walk the dog.
Have breakfast with my wife and children.
Have sex again.
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.
Do three hours' work.
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.
Do another three hours' work.
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids.
Meditate for half an hour.
Have sex.
Walk the dog. Have sex again.
Go to bed.
How often do you think I have that day?
We need to be realistic.
You can't do it all in one day.
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the "I'll have a life when I retire, when my kids have left home, when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left."
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.
There's got to be a middle way.
A fourth observation: We need to approach balance in a balanced way.
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.
It's totally dominated by work.
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.
All of my relationships have failed.
There's nothing in my life apart from my work.
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.
So I joined a gym."
Now I don't mean to mock, but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn't more balanced; it's more fit.
Lovely though physical exercise may be, there are other parts to life -- there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side; there's the spiritual side.
And to be balanced, I believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches.
Now that can be daunting.
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.
You want me to go to church and call my mother."
And I understand.
I truly understand how that can be daunting.
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective.
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" -- Harry -- "up from school."
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates.
We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games.
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe, and we shared a pizza for two, then walked down the hill to our home, and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas.
I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."
I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate," and walked out of his bedroom.
As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day of my life, ever."
I hadn't done anything, hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.
Now my point is the small things matter.
Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.
With the smallest investment in the right places, you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life.
Moreover, I think, it can transform society.
Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like.
And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading.

<title>Sam Harris: Science can answer moral questions</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Questions of good and evil, right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science. But Sam Harris argues that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues, shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life.</description>
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values.
Now, it's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value.
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life: questions like, "What is worth living for?"
"What is worth dying for?"
"What constitutes a good life?"
So, I'm going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history.
Now, it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values, because science deals with facts, and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be.
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.
Values are a certain kind of fact.
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.
Now, the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim: This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.
And there's no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes.
Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which, of course, may or may not be true.
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life, for human beings, we know that there is a continuum of such facts.
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state, where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately.
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic, to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.
And we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space.
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?
Probably not.
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye, so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand these truths.
And morality relates to these truths.
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements.
But if we're going to talk about human well-being we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death.
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain.
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing our brains.
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can, at least in principle, be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience, psychology, etc.
So, what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings.
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings.
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape, with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective.
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access.
And these await our discovery.
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual.
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them.
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space, or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question.
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child, or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.
But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
And just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality, and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future.
For instance, there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal, where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard, and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.
And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally, are subjected to this every year.
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.
We're not talking about Connecticut.
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod, lest we spoil the child -- this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.
But we can ask the obvious question: Is it a good idea, generally speaking, to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior?
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer, and that it matters?
Now, many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined, and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.
And so, how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being?
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
The concept of physical health is undefined.
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30.
It's now around 80 in the developed world.
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does not make it vacuous.
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape: There may be equivalent ways to thrive; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing.
Now, why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality?
Well think of how we talk about food: I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat.
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food.
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison.
The fact that there are many right answers to the question, "What is food?"
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie, and if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth.
Why would we think this?
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.
Now, if you're going to play good chess, a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen," is very good to follow.
But it clearly admits some exceptions.
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.
Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
Consider the great problem of women's bodies: What to do about them?
Well this is one thing you can do about them: You can cover them up.
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that while we may not like this, we might think of this as "wrong" in Boston or Palo Alto, who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags?
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable, or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?
Well, who are we not to say this?
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.
But what does voluntary mean in a community where, when a girl gets raped, her father's first impulse, rather often, is to murder her out of shame?
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute: Your daughter gets raped, and what you want to do is kill her.
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?
Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society.
For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world.
Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.
But if we are in a reflective mood, we can ask, "Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"
I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children?
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance.
Perhaps there are many such places -- again, given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak.
Now the irony, from my perspective, is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another.
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being.
In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering.
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.
But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need a universal conception of human values.
Now, what stands in the way of this?
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular, academic, scientist types.
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion, and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness.
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women.
So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time.
Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about -- really right about -- or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science.
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other."
Notice that we don't do this in science.
On the left you have Edward Witten.
He's a string theorist.
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around, in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said,"String theory is bogus.
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale.
I'm not a fan."
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist; I don't understand string theory.
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
But this is just the point.
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded.
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
That is what it is for knowledge to count.
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise, or moral talent, or moral genius even?
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count?
How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering?
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No.
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing, and morality relates to that domain of facts.
It is possible for individuals, and even for whole cultures, to care about the wrong things, which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering.
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less, and they will one day mean nothing.
We live in a world filled with destructive technology, and this technology cannot be uninvented; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them.
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads, or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world, hearing some of this, may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.
Language seems to be really important here.
When you're talking about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.
And some of them would say something else. They would say, "No, you know, this is a celebration of female specialness, it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" -- and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view -- "that male lust is not to be trusted."
I mean, can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence, watching the clock ticking, but the question is: What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations, and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself?
And so, if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil, or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face -- I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under.
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially when it's 120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa.
CA: A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress.
But can you reconcile that?
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward, 100 years forward, how you would like to think of the world, balancing moral progress with richness.
SH: Well, I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail.
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion, and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it -- whether they're genetic, whether they're how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems, and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space.
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.
It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women.
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea -- but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them.
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.
CA: And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues?
SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact, that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system.
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."
If you get all those parts aligned, yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context.
It's all of us in this together, not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.
CA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours.
We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.
SH: Really an honor. Thank you.

<title>Kavita Ramdas: Radical women, embracing tradition</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Investing in women can unlock infinite potential around the globe. But how can women walk the line between Western-style empowerment and traditional culture? Kavita Ramdas of the Global Fund for Women talks about three encounters with powerful women who fight to make the world better -- while preserving the traditions that sustain them.</description>
Salaam. Namaskar.
Good morning.
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing -- how to invest in women, how to empower them, how to save them.
Not me.
I am interested in how women are saving us.
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities, polarities we've taken for granted for a long time, like the ones between modernity and tradition, First World and Third World, oppression and opportunity.
In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community, there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing.
What intrigues me most is how women are doing this, despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating.
Why is it that women are, on the one hand, viciously oppressed by cultural practices, and yet at the same time, are the preservers of cultures in most societies?
Is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance?
When so many women and girls are beaten, raped, maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes -- honor, religion, nationality -- what allows women to replant trees, to rebuild societies, to lead radical, non-violent movements for social change?
Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?
Or are they one and the same?
Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford, of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are, in fact, many?
And what, if anything, do men have to do with it?
Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions.
It's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people.
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle.
Among those who've helped open my eyes to a third way are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan, a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia.
I'm indebted to them, as I am to my parents, who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life, were blessed with three daughters in this one.
And for reasons equally unclear to me, seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.
I was born and raised here in India, and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down, pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all, "Poor things. You only have three daughters.
But you're young, you could still try again."
My sense of outrage about women's rights was brought to a boil when I was about 11.
My aunt, an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman, was widowed early.
A flock of relatives descended on her.
They took off her colorful sari.
They made her wear a white one.
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.
They broke her bangles.
Her daughter, Rani, a few years older than me, sat in her lap bewildered, not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother.
Late that night, I heard my mother begging my father, "Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"
And my father, in a low voice, muttering, "I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.
This is tradition."
That's the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world.
Women don't make those rules, but they define us, and they define our opportunities and our chances.
And men are affected by those rules too.
My father, who had fought in three wars, could not save his own sister from this suffering.
By 18, under the excellent tutelage of my mother, I was therefore, as you might expect, defiantly feminist.
On the streets chanting, "[Hindi] [Hindi] We are the women of India.
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."
By the time I got to Beijing in 1995, it was clear to me, the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition.
Soon after I returned from Beijing, I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization, founded by women, to support women's rights organizations around the globe.
But barely six months into my new job, I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.
She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States.
She said to me, "It is not about the burka."
She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard.
She told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside Afghanistan, and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning, had started a school in Pakistan.
She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows is that the Koran requires and strongly supports literacy.
The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves."
Had I heard right?
Was a women's rights advocate invoking religion?
But Sakena defies labels.
She always wears a headscarf, but I've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze.
She starts every lecture with a prayer, but she's a single, feisty, financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.
She is also immensely pragmatic.
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says, "give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work.
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp, I went to see the imam.
I told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive.'" She smiles slyly.
"He was flattered.
He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque.
And after he would leave, women and girls would stay behind.
We began with a small literacy class to read the Koran, then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.
In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes."
Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.
She is on the Taliban's hit list.
I worry about her every time she travels across that country.
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.
"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.
Look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face."
And I smile, and I nod, realizing I'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices, turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity.
Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different.
Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia know all too well.
To be a lesbian, a dyke, a homosexual in most parts of the world, including right here in our country, India, is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice.
In post-conflict societies like Croatia, where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast.
So enter a group of out dykes, young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia, from Serbia to Slovenia.
These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.
Many have struggled to come out to their communities, in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick, just queer.
As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says, "I like traditional music very much.
I also like rock and roll.
So Lesbor, we blend the two.
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion, in which people can really speak their voice, especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.
After the war, lots of these songs were lost, but they are a part of our childhood and our history, and we should not forget them."
Improbably, this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change, like alchemists turning discord into harmony.
Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem, a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets.
And, Leah adds with a grin, "Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music, because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT."
Their concerts draw from their own communities, yes, but also from an older generation: a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality, but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.
One father, who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir, now writes songs for them.
In the Middle Ages, troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses: Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this, singing, connecting people divided by religion, nationality and language.
Bosnians, Croats and Serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history, and Lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all.
Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given.
The world Leymah Gbowee was given was a world at war.
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.
Leymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.
But she was sick with worry: She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier, she worried her daughters would be raped, she worried for their lives.
One night, she had a dream.
She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed.
The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.
They were all tired of the fighting.
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace.
Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.
She promised to raise the issue with her community.
At the next Friday sermon, the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs.
"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian."
This small group of women, determined to bring an end to the war, and they chose to use their traditions to make a point: Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.
But no, for the protest, they dressed all in white, no makeup.
As Leymah said, "We wore the white saying we were out for peace."
They stood on the side of the road on which Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.
They stood for weeks -- first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women -- wearing white, singing, dancing, saying they were out for peace.
Eventually, opposing forces in Liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.
Leymah and her sisters had had enough.
With their remaining funds, they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building.
In a now famous CNN clip, you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].
Then things get tense.
The police are called in to physically remove the women.
As the senior officer approaches with a baton, Leymah stands up with deliberation, reaches her arms up over her head, and begins, very slowly, to untie her headdress that covers her hair.
You can see the policeman's face.
He looks embarrassed. He backs away.
And the next thing you know, the police have disappeared.
Leymah said to me later, "It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.
If an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to, the man's family is cursed."
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed, but he knew we were not going to leave.
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."
And the peace accord was signed.
And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years.
When she made her presidential address, she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia who allowed her to win against a football star -- that's soccer for you Americans -- no less.
Women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind.
They've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way.
A Filipina activist once said to me, "How do you cook a rice cake?
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."
The protests, the marches, the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights, full stop.
That's the heat from the bottom.
That's Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades.
But we also need the heat from the top.
And in most parts of the world, that top is still controlled by men.
So to paraphrase Marx: Women make change, but not in circumstances of their own choosing.
They have to negotiate.
They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations.
And they need allies from their communities.
Allies like the imam, allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in Croatia, allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away, allies like my father, who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams.
Maybe this is because feminism, unlike almost every other social movement, is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor -- it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers -- it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women, far too often, hold ourselves.
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism, that the personal is in fact the political.
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights, the same is true of gender equality: that it starts in small places, close to home.
On the streets, yes, but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends.
And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles, women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah -- but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran -- are doing something else.
They're challenging the very notion of Western models of development.
They are saying, we don't have to be like you to make change.
We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou, and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers.
We can use our tradition to navigate change.
We can demilitarize societies and pour resources, instead, into reservoirs of genuine security.
It is in these little stories, these individual stories, that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world.
It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities, that I find hope.
And if my heart is singing, it's because in these little fragments, every now and again, you catch a glimpse of a whole, of a whole new world.
And she is definitely on her way.
Thank you.

<title>Kathryn Schulz: On being wrong</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong. But what if we're wrong about that? "Wrongologist" Kathryn Schulz makes a compelling case for not just admitting but embracing our fallibility.</description>
So it's 1995, I'm in college, and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence, Rhode Island to Portland, Oregon.
And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests -- basically the longest route we can possibly take.
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles.
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"
My friend looks at me totally blankly.
There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.
And I'm like, "You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them."
She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about.
And what I'm talking about is this.
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.
I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us, and how we behave when that happens, and what all of this can tell us about human nature.
In other words, as you heard Chris say, I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong.
This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition.
In fact, most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong, or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong.
We get it in the abstract.
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.
But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the beliefs I hold, here in the present tense, suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window -- and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.
We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life, trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything.
I think this is a problem.
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right.
And second, why it's such a problem.
And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right?
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.
So let me ask you guys something -- or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here: How does it feel -- emotionally -- how does it feel to be wrong?
Dreadful. Thumbs down.
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing -- thank you, these are great answers, but they're answers to a different question.
You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you're wrong?
Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake.
But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything.
I'll give you an analogy.
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon, there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff, which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.
And what's funny -- at least if you're six years old -- is that the coyote's totally fine too.
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air.
That's when he falls.
When we're wrong about something -- not when we realize it, but before that -- we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground.
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.
It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right.
So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.
I call this error blindness.
Most of the time, we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something, until it's too late.
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural.
Think back for a moment to elementary school.
You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this.
This is not mine, by the way.
So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework.
So by the time you are nine years old, you've already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes.
We learn these really bad lessons really well.
And a lot of us -- and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers.
Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.
Okay, so fine.
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.
Because according to this, getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us.
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe.
So let me tell you a story.
A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.
Beth Israel's in Boston.
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard -- one of the best hospitals in the country.
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.
Everything seems to have gone fine.
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one.
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting.
He said, "For whatever reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient."
The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous.
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.
And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy.
So this is a huge practical problem.
But it's also a huge social problem.
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you?
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant.
They don't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots.
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.
So this is a catastrophe.
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.
But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place.
And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this.
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about "I think therefore I am," this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" -- "I err therefore I am."
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome.
It's totally fundamental to who we are.
Because, unlike God, we don't really know what's going on out there.
And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.
To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.
Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life.
And so I'm listening and I'm listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong.
And my first thought was, "I've lost it.
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.
I just imagined it everywhere," which has happened.
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, "No actually, that's true.
In fact," he says, "as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme.
And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work."
And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up.
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings.
When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong.
But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this.
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead.
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
And something else happened instead.
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.
And something else happened instead.
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.
And something else happened instead.
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize.
And something else happened instead.
I mean, this is life.
For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us.
No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong.
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements?
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh.
Didn't really work out that way, did it?
Where's my jet pack, Chris?
So here we are again.
And that's how it goes.
We come up with another idea.
We tell another story.
We hold another conference.
The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder.
And to me, if you really want to rediscover wonder, you need to step outside of that tiny, terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say, "Wow, I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong."
Thank you.
Thank you guys.

<title>Leymah Gbowee: Unlock the intelligence, passion, greatness of girls</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nobel Peace Prize winner Leymah Gbowee has two powerful stories to tell -- of her own life's transformation, and of the untapped potential of girls around the world. Can we transform the world by unlocking the greatness of girls?</description>
Many times I go around the world to speak, and people ask me questions about the challenges, my moments, some of my regrets.
1998: A single mother of four, three months after the birth of my fourth child, I went to do a job as a research assistant.
I went to Northern Liberia.
And as part of the work, the village would give you lodgings.
And they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter.
This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade.
She was the laughing stock of the community.
Her mother was often told by other women, "You and your child will die poor."
After two weeks of working in that village, it was time to go back.
The mother came to me, knelt down, and said, "Leymah, take my daughter.
I wish for her to be a nurse."
Dirt poor, living in the home with my parents, I couldn't afford to.
With tears in my eyes, I said, "No."
Two months later, I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief.
The women's chief of the village has this little girl, fair color like me, totally dirty.
And all day she walked around only in her underwear.
When I asked, "Who is that?"
She said, "That's Wei.
The meaning of her name is pig.
Her mother died while giving birth to her, and no one had any idea who her father was."
For two weeks, she became my companion, slept with me.
I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll.
The night before I left, she came to the room and said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.
I wish to go with you.
I wish to go to school."
Dirt poor, no money, living with my parents, I again said, "No."
Two months later, both of those villages fell into another war.
Till today, I have no idea where those two girls are.
Fast-forward, 2004: In the peak of our activism, the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.
I want you to bring her home because we don't have safe homes."
The story of this little girl: She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months.
She came to me bloated, very pale.
Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor.
She'd lie beside me and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.
I wish to go to school."
2010: A young woman stands before President Sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together, their father and mother died during the war.
She's 19; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them.
She's highly athletic.
One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship.
Full scholarship. She gets it.
Her dream of going to school, her wish of being educated, is finally here.
She goes to school on the first day.
The director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class.
And for the next three years, her fate will be having sex with him every day, as a favor for getting her in school.
Globally, we have policies, international instruments, work leaders.
Great people have made commitments -- we will protect our children from want and from fear.
The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Countries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.
Other countries come with different things.
There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls.
All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally, I think, has failed.
In Liberia, for example, the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls.
Teen prostitution is at its peak.
In one community, we're told, you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night.
It's disheartening, it's sad.
And then someone asked me, just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago, "So where is the hope?"
Several years ago, a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women.
It's not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls' kids are totally out there and no hope, or seemingly no hope.
We created a space called the Young Girls Transformative Project.
We go into rural communities and all we do, like has been done in this room, is create the space.
When these girls sit, you unlock intelligence, you unlock passion, you unlock commitment, you unlock focus, you unlock great leaders.
Today, we've worked with over 300.
And some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps, as young mothers, to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women.
One young woman I met, teen mother of four, never thought about finishing high school, graduated successfully; never thought about going to college, enrolled in college.
One day she said to me, "My wish is to finish college and be able to support my children."
She's at a place where she can't find money to go to school.
She sells water, sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones.
And you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education.
Juanita is her name.
She takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school.
Says, "Leymah, my wish is to be educated.
And if I can't be educated, when I see some of my sisters being educated, my wish has been fulfilled.
I wish for a better life.
I wish for food for my children.
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."
This is the dream of the African girl.
Several years ago, there was one African girl.
This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry.
Angry, frustrated, really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children, this young girl started a movement, a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace.
I will fulfill the wish.
This is another African girl's wish.
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.
I failed to do this.
These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- I failed, I failed, I failed.
So I will do this.
Women came out, protested a brutal dictator, fearlessly spoke.
Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true, the wish of peace came true.
This young woman wished also to go to school.
She went to school.
This young woman wished for other things to happen, it happened for her.
Today, this young woman is me, a Nobel laureate.
I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish, in my tiny capacity, of little African girls -- the wish of being educated.
We set up a foundation.
We're giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential.
I don't have much to ask of you.
I've also been to places in this U.S., and I know that girls in this country also have wishes, a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx, a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A., a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas, a wish for a better life somewhere in New York, a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey.
Will you journey with me to help that girl, be it an African girl or an American girl or a Japanese girl, fulfill her wish, fulfill her dream, achieve that dream?
Because all of these great innovators and inventors that we've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world, and all they're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence, unlock the passion, unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves.
Let's journey together. Let's journey together.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much.
Right now in Liberia, what do you see as the main issue that troubles you?
LG: I've been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.
As part of my work, I'm doing these tours in different villages and towns -- 13, 15 hours on dirt roads -- and there is no community that I've gone into that I haven't seen intelligent girls.
But sadly, the vision of a great future, or the dream of a great future, is just a dream, because you have all of these vices.
Teen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.
So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place, and I just don't want to be the only one at this place.
I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me.
I want to look back 20 years from now and see that there's another Liberian girl, Ghanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage.
And maybe, just maybe, saying, "Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today."
So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope.
But I'm also not pessimistic, because I know it doesn't take a lot to get them charged up.
CA: And in the last year, tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening.
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.
But in the last year, where President Sirleaf comes from, her village, we went there to work with these girls.
And we could not find 25 girls in high school.
All of these girls went to the gold mine, and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things.
We took 50 of those girls and we worked with them.
And this was at the beginning of elections.
This is one place where women were never -- even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men.
These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration.
This is a real rural village.
And the theme they used was: "Even pretty girls vote."
They were able to mobilize young women.
But not only did they do that, they went to those who were running for seats to ask them, "What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win?"
And one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws, and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric.
Rape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.
And when the girls started engaging him, he was very hostile towards them.
These little girls turned to him and said, "We will vote you out of office."
He's out of office today.
CA: Leymah, thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED.
LG: You're welcome.

<title>Leslie T. Chang: The voices of China's workers</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of workers -- the millions of people who migrate to factories in China and other emerging countries to make goods sold all over the world. Reporter Leslie T. Chang sought out women who work in one of China's booming megacities, and tells their stories.</description>
Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day: our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes, or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad.
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make, and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves.
After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?
It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive, and that it's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so.
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing, especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world, but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways.
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world, including its own, thanks to a combination of factors: its low costs, its large and educated workforce, and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands.
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets, we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone.
Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods.
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills, and to see the world.
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.
Here are a few.
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker, so I'm not in a rush."
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year, everyone said I had changed. They asked me, what did you do that you have changed so much?
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more, they won't understand anyway."
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money, it won't satisfy me.
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English, because in the future, our customers won't be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women, 18 or 19 years old.
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.
Certain subjects came up over and over: how much money they made, what kind of husband they hoped to marry, whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were.
Other subjects came up almost never, including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life: 10 or 15 workers in one room, 50 people sharing a single bathroom, days and nights ruled by the factory clock.
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances, and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China.
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made, and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did.
When I asked Lu Qingmin, the young woman I got to know best, what exactly she did on the factory floor, she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like "qiu xi."
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying "QC," or quality control.
She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand.
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism, the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets, the worker in an industrial factory has no control, no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work.
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum, he got this one wrong.
Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that, a piece of something.
What she does with the money she earns, what she learns in that place, and how it changes her, these are the things that matter.
What a factory makes is never the point, and the workers could not care less who buys their products.
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories, on the other hand, plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make.
Many articles calculate: How long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he's making?
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.
But how meaningful is this calculation, really?
For example, I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine, but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.
But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker, and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.
Their calculations are different.
How long should I stay in this factory?
How much money can I save?
How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car, to get married, or to put my child through school?
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor.
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min, she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year.
On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
I thanked her, assuming it was fake, like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.
After we got home, Min gave her mother another present: a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag, and a few nights later, her sister was showing off a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory, and every single one of them was authentic.
Min's sister said to her parents, "In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."
Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.
"And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line, 2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or 6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000."
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her for the new year, said, "It doesn't look like it's worth that much."
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually understand these things. You don't understand shit."
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.
They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married, she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.
Another time, after Min had already left the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit, bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.
I looked in the zippered pocket of one, and I found a printed card in English, which read, "An American classic.
In 1941, the burnished patina of an all-American baseball glove inspired the founder of Coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born."
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters.
Their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated, surprising and funny than he could have imagined.
And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses, to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory.
Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs five times, eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory.
Later, she married a fellow migrant worker, moved with him to his village, gave birth to two daughters, and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents.
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes, temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village.
In a recent email to me, she explained, "A person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her, one third of them women, who have left their villages to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities.
Together, they make up the largest migration in history, and it is globalization, this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think.
Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be.
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them, or that they would have nothing to say to me.
Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous.
By opening up their lives to me, they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world.
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me on the train home to visit her family.
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women I wrote about, ties that are not economic but personal in nature, measured not in money but in memories.
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine, sitting in your office or in the library, are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight that a lot of us haven't had before.
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say, with Apple's head of manufacturing, what would you say?
Leslie Chang: One minute?
CA: One minute.
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven, resourceful, and the thing that struck me, what they want most is education, to learn, because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.
Their parents are often illiterate, and then they come to the city, and they, on their own, at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class, they'll take an English class, and learn really, really rudimentary things, you know, like how to type a document in Word, or how to say really simple things in English.
So, if you really want to help these workers, start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes in these schools, and what's going to happen is, all your workers are going to move on, but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple, and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement.
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.
They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."
I mean, it would be nice to have those things, but that's not why they're in the city, and that's not what they care about.
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth, that things over time were getting better?
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know, it was interesting, because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city, Dongguan, and over that time, you could see immense change in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways, but generally upward.
If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now basically urban middle class people, so the trajectory is definitely upward.
It's just hard to see when you're suddenly sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and desperate, but that's not really how it is.
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough, and it's nothing you or I would want to do, but from their perspective, where they're coming from is much worse, and where they're going is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give that context of what's going on in their minds, not what necessarily is going on in yours.
CA: Thanks so much for your talk.
Thank you very much.

<title>Neil MacGregor: 2600 years of history in one object</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A clay cylinder covered in Akkadian cuneiform script, damaged and broken, the Cyrus Cylinder is a powerful symbol of religious tolerance and multi-culturalism. In this enthralling talk Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, traces 2600 years of Middle Eastern history through this single object.</description>
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us.
We perish, they survive; we have one life, they have many lives, and in each life they can mean different things.
Which means that, while we all have one biography, they have many.
I want this morning to talk about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies -- of one particular object, one remarkable thing.
It doesn't, I agree, look very much.
It's about the size of a rugby ball.
It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun.
And as you can see, it's been knocked about a bit, which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879.
But today, this thing is, I believe, a major player in the politics of the Middle East.
And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet.
The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces, the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change.
And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with, Belshazzar's feast -- because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war of 539 BC.
And the parallels between the events of 539 BC and 2003 and in between are startling.
What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting, now in the National Gallery in London, illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures.
And you all know roughly the story.
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon.
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon.
Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast.
And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels.
He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia.
And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall, "You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians."
And that very night Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.
It is, of course, a great moment in the history of the Jewish people.
It's a great story. It's story we all know.
"The writing on the wall" is part of our everyday language.
What happened next was remarkable, and it's where our cylinder enters the story.
Cyrus, king of the Persians, has entered Babylon without a fight -- the great empire of Babylon, which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean, falls to Cyrus.
And Cyrus makes a declaration.
And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people.
In ringing Babylonian -- it was written in Babylonian -- he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe, the great king, the powerful king, king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got.
And it's written, as we'll see in due course, by very skilled P.R. consultants.
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.
And what is the great king, the powerful king, the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?
He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon, he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar -- have captured and enslaved go free.
He'll let them return to their countries.
And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated.
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home, and they'll take with them their gods.
And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way, in their own place.
This is the decree, this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews, after the exile in Babylon, the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon, weeping when they remembered Jerusalem, those Jews were allowed to go home.
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple.
It's a central document in Jewish history.
And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms.
This is the Jewish version of the same story.
"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia, 'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem.
Who is there among you of his people?
The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.'" "Go up" -- aaleh.
The central element, still, of the notion of return, a central part of the life of Judaism.
As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism.
And that change, that great historic moment, was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia, reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay.
Two great texts, what about the politics?
What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.
The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians, united under Cyrus, became the first great world empire.
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.
And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control.
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale.
And it had to be run in a quite new way.
It had to be run in different languages.
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.
And it had to recognize their different habits, different peoples, different religions, different faiths.
All of those are respected by Cyrus.
Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.
And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander.
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together.
The Greek invasions ended that.
And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented.
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central.
The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book "Cyropaedia" promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.
And throughout European culture afterward, Cyrus remained the model.
This is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was.
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution.
Jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state.
Meanwhile, back in Babylon, things had not been going well.
After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.
And it enters now another story.
It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century: Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?
We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures.
No other evidence.
Suddenly, this appeared.
And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true.
It's a great 19th century moment.
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated.
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect.
The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.
And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand, calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon.
Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free.
And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk.
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this.
For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen.
It can only be Jehovah.
And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people.
It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact.
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions.
The question is, which god was it?
And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion.
And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah, and yet, Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk.
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course, "I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me."
I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.
Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts.
That's 1879.
40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world.
This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return.
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.
And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan.
You all know what happened.
The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.
And another story of the cylinder begins.
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide, has to be kept safe from communism, and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran, the Shah.
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history, or a return to Iranian history, that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder.
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis, he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran, and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty.
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
10 years later, another story: Iranian Revolution, 1979.
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks.
Then another Iran-Iraq war.
And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won.
It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians -- Muslims and non-Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran, people who are devout, not devout.
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan.
It's the only object they want.
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time.
It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani.
It was a huge event.
This is the other side of that same picture.
It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months.
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West.
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths.
And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.
To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it.
It became a great emblem, a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad.
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?
This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return.
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran.
It was a narrative presented by the president himself.
And for me, to take this object to Iran, to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is, what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today.
It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration.
It stands with the American constitution.
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta.
It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region.
A replica of this is at the United Nations.
In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place.
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures.
It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories.
And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder?
The right of peoples to live together in the same state, worshiping differently, freely -- a Middle East, a world, in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate.
In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill.
But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder.
Thank you.

<title>Joshua Klein: A thought experiment on the intelligence of crows</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Hacker and writer Joshua Klein is fascinated by crows. After a long amateur study of corvid behavior, he's come up with an elegant thought experiment: a machine that could form a new bond between animal and human.</description>
How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?
Any of you get really freaked out by that?
You might want to leave now.
So, this is a vending machine for crows.
And over the past few days, many of you have been asking me, "How did you come to this? How did you get started doing this?"
And it started, as with many great ideas, or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway, at a cocktail party.
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine, and we're sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess.
And he was telling me that really, we ought to try and eradicate these things.
We gotta kill them because they're making a mess.
I said that was stupid, you know, maybe we should just train them to do something useful.
And he said that was impossible.
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it's impossible.
So, I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.
And after 10 years of this, my wife eventually said, "Look, you know, you gotta do this thing you've been talking about, and build the vending machine."
So I did.
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.
And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.
So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.
So, I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial.
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.
And so I built the vending machine.
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows.
It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving.
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.
And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings.
So we may not think about them, but they're always around.
And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now.
And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities.
We're seeing a population boom with crows.
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.
So that's no great surprise.
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.
And I'll give you an example of that.
So this is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow.
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.
But the researchers had a problem.
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.
You see, it wasn't working very well.
So she adapted.
Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before.
No one taught her to bend this into a hook, had shown her how it could happen.
But she did it all on her own.
So keep in mind that she's never seen this done.
Right.
Yeah. All right.
That's the part where the researchers freak out.
So, it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really, really intelligent.
Their brains are proportionate, in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have.
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.
And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.
On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington, they, a few years ago, were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.
Some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, these crows, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them, and run around and make their life kind of miserable.
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week.
And the next month. And after summer break.
Until they finally graduated and left campus, and -- glad to get away, I'm sure -- came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.
So -- the moral being, don't piss off crows.
So now, students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask.
It's fairly interesting.
So we know that these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.
Video: Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments.
In this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage: drop it among the traffic.
The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.
Joshua Klein: Yeah, yeah. Pretty interesting.
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts.
In fact, that's old hat for crows.
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo.
And since that time, all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.
And now, every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk, waiting to collect its lunch.
So, they're learning from each other. And research bears this out.
Parents seem to be teaching their young.
They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies.
If I have a little extra time, I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely.
The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation.
And as we heard yesterday, that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble, and we're starting to see it with them.
They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment, which is really useful if you live in a city.
So we know that there's lots of crows.
We found out they're really smart, and we found out that they can teach each other.
And when all this became clear to me, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.
So that's what we did.
This is a vending machine for crows.
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.
It's pretty simple.
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field, or someplace where there's lots of crows, and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.
And crows eventually come by, and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there.
And eventually, they eat up all the peanuts.
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray, and they hop up and help themselves.
And then they leave, and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is really dandy, if you're a crow.
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.
So, when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.
Now, they're used to the sound of the machine, and they keep coming back, and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there.
And when they get really happy about this, we go ahead and stymie them.
And we move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off.
So, they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak.
And they do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot, and when that happens, they get a peanut.
And so this goes on for some time.
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put the coin in the slot, and then they get their peanut.
And when they're really good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, in which they show up and nothing happens.
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored, and then they go off and play in traffic.
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.
They know that this machine's been messing with them, through three different stages of behavior.
They figure it's gotta have more to it.
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that, "Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, lying around on the ground," hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot.
And then, we're off to the races.
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts, until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.
So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.
Instead, I think we should look a little bit larger.
I think that crows can be trained to do other things.
For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics?
Or maybe do search and rescue?
The main thing, the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.
We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them, but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.
Thanks very much.

<title>David Logan: Tribal leadership</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: David Logan talks about the five kinds of tribes that humans naturally form -- in schools, workplaces, even the driver's license bureau. By understanding our shared tribal tendencies, we can help lead each other to become better individuals.</description>
What we're really here to talk about is the "how."
Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation?
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.
We'll go back a little more than a year.
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?
It was February 3rd, 2008.
Anyone remember what happened, February 3rd, 2008?
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.
And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened.
And they had discussed things of great national importance.
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
And if you go back in time to February 3rd, it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.
But when we talked to people, it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States.
Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people.
And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.
But not just work. It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen.
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives from various tribal councils that met, also known as Super Bowl parties, we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.
We said, "The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama."
Now, the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.
All of you are members of tribes.
In walking around at the break, many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do, which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe, and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe, and make introductions.
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.
So here is the bottom line.
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.
And so people form tribes.
They always have. They always will.
Just as fish swim and birds fly, people form tribes. It's just what we do.
But here's the rub.
Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture.
Now here is the net out of this.
You're all a member of tribes.
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.
You don't want this. Okay?
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.
Stage One produces people who do horrible things.
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes, and then pool together with people who think like they do.
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons.
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.
And I want to make the point that as members of society, we need to.
It's not enough to simply write people off.
But let's move on to Stage Two.
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."
So, this other book that Steve mentioned, that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance," my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I, argue that as people see the world, so they behave.
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks, then their behavior will follow automatically from that.
It will be despairing hostility.
They'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means undermining other people.
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly, and my driver's license expires.
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe, which looks like this.
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?
No. But in the one near me, where I have to go in just a few days, what I will say when I'm standing in line is, "How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"
Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?
Actually, no, I'm not.
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.
So in a Stage Two culture -- and we find these in all sorts of different places -- you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.
You find them in all places in society.
I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class.
But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe, in effect, "My life sucks.
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.
What kind of innovation would get done?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?
In fact it would be basically nil.
Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us.
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.
And we park. And we stay.
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
I'm great and you're not.
Now imagine having a whole room of people saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that."
A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.
I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine?"
And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, "Well while you were, you know, doing your research," -- notice the condescending tone -- "While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."
And the third one got the same wry smile and said, "Well, while you were off doing your research, and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery, that eventually we'll train monkeys to do, or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all, I was off running the future of the residency program, which is really the future of medicine."
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.
And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.
Now, we find these in places where really smart, successful people show up.
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four.
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.
And my question on the other side is just going to be, "What do you think they value?"
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.
This is their lobby.
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.
Notice people are applauding for us.
They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did they probably wouldn't applaud.
But you'll notice the level of excitement.
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.
Now, what's important to people at Zappos, these may not be the things that are important to you.
But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.
So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence, then something very important happens.
The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger, into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.
There is, in fact, another stage.
Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great," this may seem a little incongruous.
This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.
Now think about that. South Africa, terrible atrocities had happened in the society.
And people came together focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.
There was no road map. No one had ever done anything like this before.
And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause, what this group accomplished was historic.
And people, at the time, feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone, descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end.
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.
So, people hear this and they conclude the following, as did we in doing the study.
Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?
I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.
I really don't want to just say "I'm great," because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this.
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it, the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights.
I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great, oriented only by our values, no other guidance.
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant, also known as King George.
We're great! Who is not great? England!"
Sorry.
Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?
What about Martin Luther King?
I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.
In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.
He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."
Why did he do that? Because most people are not at Stage Five.
Two percent are at Stage One.
About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, "My life sucks."
48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes, say, "I'm great and you're not."
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.
Only about 22 percent of tribes are at Stage Four, oriented by our values, saying "We're great.
And our values are beginning to unite us."
Only two percent, only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five.
And those are the ones that change the world.
So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society.
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.
So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels, to go to where they are.
And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level.
I'd like to show you some examples of this.
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan, former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.
He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" -- to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.
I don't know anybody.
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.
So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."
In fact, that's progress.
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then, over time, getting them connected.
So, what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four?
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.
TED represents a set of values, and as we unite around these values, something really interesting begins to emerge.
If you want this experience to live on as something historic, then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking.
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them.
That's called a triadic relationship.
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.
They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves.
And ultimately that adds to their values.
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five?
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization.
You know they do polls, right?
So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.
So, they were bored.
They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.
"How could we, instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks, or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that, what does the entire world think?"
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics, who reported being bored.
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population of Sub-Saharan Africa?
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology, and speak languages we don't speak, and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order to achieve on this great mission, we have to be able to do it.
Incidentally, they did pull it off.
And they released the first-ever world poll.
So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.
First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.
You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach of the tribes that you have.
But the question on the table is this: What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making?
You're hearing one presentation after another, often representing a group of people, a tribe, about how they have changed the world.
If you do what we've talked about, you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.
And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.
You remember to talk all five culture stages.
Because we've got people in all five, around us.
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this: Will your tribes change the world?
Thank you very much.

<title>Frederick Balagadde: Bio-lab on a microchip</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Drugs alone can't stop disease in sub-Saharan Africa: We need diagnostic tools to match. TED Senior Fellow Frederick Balagadde shows how we can multiply the power and availability of an unwieldy, expensive diagnostic lab -- by miniaturizing it to the size of a chip.</description>
The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden.
If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest, we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.
We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.
There are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics.
So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications.
And this has already saved millions of lives, and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The problem is that, what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem.
And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda.
This was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV/AIDS.
So this became one of the driving passions of my life, to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems.
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.
Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room, and people actually used to work inside the computers.
But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone.
And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world, in the Third World countries.
The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories.
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips.
I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school, and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices.
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.
A close look at how the technology works: These are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system.
So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system.
So, with one microfluidic chip, which is the size of an iPhone, you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time.
For each patient, we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient.
And this is only done in four hours, 50 times faster than the current state of the art, at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options.
So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place.
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality.
Thank you very much.

<title>Jonathan Drori: The beautiful tricks of flowers</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this visually dazzling talk, Jonathan Drori shows the extraordinary ways flowering plants -- over a quarter million species -- have evolved to attract insects to spread their pollen: growing 'landing-strips' to guide the insects in, shining in ultraviolet, building elaborate traps, and even mimicking other insects in heat.</description>
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
Why would they go to that bother?
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.
There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
Now this is a plant.
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.
And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.
Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.
So flies love this.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.
So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.
This thing does something else which is unusual.
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.
"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.
Well yes we can.
So what is an insect seeing?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what it looks like with visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.
And I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.
That's the main use of that filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.

<title>Young-ha Kim: Be an artist, right now!</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why do we ever stop playing and creating? With charm and humor, celebrated Korean author Young-ha Kim invokes the world's greatest artists to urge you to unleash your inner child -- the artist who wanted to play forever. </description>
The theme of my talk today is, "Be an artist, right now."
Most people, when this subject is brought up, get tense and resist it: "Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.
I have to go to school, get a job, send my kids to lessons ... " You think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."
There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.
Don't they just pop into your head?
There are so many reasons why we can't be, indeed, we're not sure why we should be.
We don't know why we should be artists, but we have many reasons why we can't be.
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.
And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.
Well you might have, but I don't think so.
This is the theme of my talk today.
We are all born artists.
If you have kids, you know what I mean.
Almost everything kids do is art.
They draw with crayons on the wall.
They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV, but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear, and because they practice such art all day long, people honestly get a little tired around kids.
Kids will sometimes perform monodramas -- playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.
And some kids, when they get a bit older, start to lie.
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
They're shocked.
"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"
She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"
But you shouldn't worry.
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.
They are talking about things they didn't see.
It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.
Parents should celebrate.
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"
All right! It calls for celebration.
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?
Where did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket."
When you have a conversation like this, the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.
Soon, a story develops.
Of course this is an infantile story, but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does.
In essence, they are not different.
Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels, "Flaubert did not write a novel.
He merely connected one sentence after another.
The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."
That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence, then, without violating the scope of the first one, writing the next sentence.
And you continue to make connections.
Take a look at this sentence: "One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."
Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it, Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
Kafka did not show his work to his father.
He was not on good terms with his father.
On his own, he wrote these sentences.
Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence, which is not much different from what a kid does.
A kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller.
Kids do art.
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.
When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand, making mountains and seas -- well, not seas, but different things -- people and dogs, etc.
But parents tell them, "It will all be washed away by the waves."
In other words, it's useless.
There's no need.
But kids don't mind.
They have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand.
Kids don't do it because someone told them to.
They aren't told by their boss or anyone, they just do it.
When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment, many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend, or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.
Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.
They talk about these kinds of experiences.
You must have had such a moment.
In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.
Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
It's a bit mischievous, actually.
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?
Playing doesn't tire us.
We can play all night long.
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.
But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.
They don't draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family.
Of course, there were kids who had to.
You know this gentleman, right?
He had to tour around Europe to support his family -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart -- but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.
Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons, but they aren't fun anymore.
You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?
If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall, you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.
Besides, if you continue to act like an artist as you get older, you'll increasingly feel pressure -- people will question your actions and ask you to act properly.
Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around and asked me, "What are you doing?"
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.
"Why are you using only black?"
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.
And I explained, "It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."
Then my teacher said, "Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."
Or so I wished.
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response.
"You'll get it!" he said.
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc., but I was coloring everything in black, so he dragged me out of the group.
There were a lot of girls there as well, so I was utterly mortified.
None of my explanations or excuses were heard, and I really got it big time.
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before, "Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing, but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.
But such a teacher is seldom found.
Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries -- I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.
Look what I found.
Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?
Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.
No crows are brought up.
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.
Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation -- essentially the same as I did.
Of course, my work was very amateur, but let's turn to more famous examples.
This is Picasso's.
He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".
That was Duchamp.
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories -- that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.
Picasso even made the statement, "I draw not what I see but what I think."
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.
Unfortunately, the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
They get locked in.
That's our tragedy.
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.
We want to express, to reveal ourselves, but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing "She's Gone" or "Hotel California," miming the guitar riffs.
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.
Some people turn into rockers like this.
Or some people dance in clubs.
People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long.
That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.
Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
They go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else, but the dad alone builds castles.
This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
You know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it?
TV is full of people who do what we wished to do, but never got to.
They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.
So we start to envy them.
We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes."
We easily say these sorts of things.
We get jealous, not because we're evil, but because we have little artists pent up inside us.
That's what I think.
What should we do then?
Yes, that's right.
Right now, we need to start our own art.
Right this minute, we can turn off TV, log off the Internet, get up and start to do something.
Where I teach students in drama school, there's a course called Dramatics.
In this course, all students must put on a play.
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.
They can write the play, for example, and the writers may work on stage art.
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it, but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.
In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.
I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.
I have another experience: In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.
I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.
Some major in art or music and think they can't write.
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
It can be a simple theme: Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!
I walk around and encourage them, "Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.
They only get to think for the first five minutes.
The reason I make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind, the artistic devil creeps in.
This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you can't write: "People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!
What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"
It will say a lot of things.
You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
The really good writing I've seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline, but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil.
The students go into a kind of trance.
After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.
So I can say this: It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist, but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.
Why we cannot be something is not important.
Most artists became artists because of the one reason.
When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art, enemies appear on the outside.
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents.
Sometimes they look like our spouses, but they are not your parents or spouses.
They are devils. Devils.
They came to Earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.
And they have a magic question.
When we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or "I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"
The magic question is, "What for?"
But art is not for anything.
Art is the ultimate goal.
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
So in response to such a pragmatic question, we need to be bold.
"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you," is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."
The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities, at least one of which is an artist.
Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat, and in front of me I saw something related to a play.
So I asked the driver, "What is this?"
He said it was his profile. "Then what are you?" I asked. "An actor," he said.
He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?"
He proudly said he played King Lear.
King Lear.
"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" -- a great line from King Lear.
That's the world I dream of.
Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.
Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter, secretly or publicly performing their own arts.
In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.
The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport and a reporter asked her a typical question: "What do you have to do to become a great dancer?
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"
Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.
In 1990, she was asked this question.
And here's what she answered: "Just do it."
Wow. I was touched.
Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it.
So what should we do now?
Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?
Just do it!
Thank you.

<title>Sasa Vucinic: Why we should invest in a free press</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A free press -- papers, magazines, radio, TV, blogs -- is the backbone of any true democracy . Sasa Vucinic, a journalist from Belgrade, talks about his new fund, which supports media by selling "free press bonds."</description>
Video: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view gives one impression.
Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on.
Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?
And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about the power of, and importance of, independent media than I could say in an hour.
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.
And also start with a little bit of statistics.
According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press.
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries.
The information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information, or colors that information, does something with it.
So they're deprived of understanding their reality.
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.
You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags, but they can also lose press freedom, as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
But that's totally another and separate topic.
So I can go back to my story.
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991.
At that time I was running B92, the only independent, for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment, where government really wants to make your life miserable.
And there are different ways.
Yeah, it was the usual cocktail: a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice, a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control, so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.
But what they really do, which is very powerful, and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they don't like independent media companies -- you know, they threaten your advertisers.
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually, you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and advertise.
And you have a problem making ends meet.
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem, which was, you know, survival below one side, but what was really painful for me was, remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall, in a slow-motion downfall.
And we all had all of that on tapes.
We had the ability to understand what was going on.
We were actually recording history.
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later; because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history.
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
It was still 1991.
He was running a media systems organization which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.
And what did I know at that time about media systems?
I would think media systems were organizations, which means they should help you.
So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans: the small one and the big one.
The small one was, I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes, so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.
Because I thought, I still maintain, that serious and independent media companies are great business.
And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country.
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office, great suit and tie.
I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be.
Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.
Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation, the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke -- is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson?
That was really the only question he had.
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies.
It's so obvious, straight in your face, and somebody must have thought of it.
Somebody must have started something like that.
And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.
You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time; you could not just Google in '91.
So I thought that that's actually my problem.
Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.
I have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros, trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank.
And basically what I was saying is very simple.
You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.
What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.
It's business anywhere.
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.
So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.
At the end of the meeting he says, look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.
See that it will not work.
He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.
I knew two things after that meeting.
First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.
But it's one thing to have a concept; it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.
So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here; I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.
You know, you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money.
You give them more money; they repay you that over a time.
You collect interest and do nothing in between.
So I thought, why don't we get into that business?
So here we are having our first client, brilliant.
First independent newspaper in Slovakia.
The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
So here's the daily newspaper that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.
It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
That means that they have no sports; they have no latest news; circulation goes down.
It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper.
They come to us with a request for a loan.
They want to -- the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press.
And we said, that's fine; let's meet; you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.
We start the meeting.
I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format, so it's much bigger.
A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.
But however you put it, you know, the numbers do not make any sense.
And that's the best they could do.
We were the best that they could do.
So that is how we understood what our method is.
It's not a bank. We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them -- by establishing management systems, by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.
Just quickly on the results.
Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing, average interest rate five percent to six percent.
Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.
And here is the most stunning number.
Return rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.
What do we typically finance?
We finance anything that a media company would need, from printing presses to transmitters.
What is most important is we do it either in form of loans, equities, lease -- whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.
But what is most important here is, who do we finance?
We believe that in the last 10 years companies that we've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world.
That is a "Who is Who" list.
And I could spend hours talking about them, because they're all kind of heroes.
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one, and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with.
You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe, and moved to Russia.
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
In the south of Russia there's a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running an independent newspaper there.
The city was closed until early '90s because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there.
After two years working with us, he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place.
Governor comes to him one day, actually invites him to come to his office.
He goes and sees the governor. The governor says, Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job, and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.
And I want to offer you a deal.
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months, because I have elections -- there are elections coming up in nine months.
I will not run, but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me.
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
I have no interest in being in media business.
How much would that cost?
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."
The governor says, "We will close you."
Boris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."
Six months later the newspaper was closed.
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one, to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.
So what the governor got was an empty shell.
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media, and if you are a banker for independent media.
So it sounds like a great story.
Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center.
We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.
But there is a second angle to that.
The second angle, like in this clip.
If you take the camera above, you start thinking about these numbers again.
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.
That is not too much, is it?
It's actually just a drop in the sea.
Because when you think about the importance, some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last session we had about Africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.
All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night -- government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption, giving voice to unheard, to poor -- it's why independent media is in business.
And it's why it was invented.
So from that perspective, what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.
Now ours is just one story.
I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work.
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
And it's called fundraising.
Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations.
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations, doing very important work.
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.
Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room.
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.
You know, instead of people running in this dark, trying to find their own match, who will be willing, who has the same goals.
Instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented.
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds, press freedom bonds.
If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit, why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit?
We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them, probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.
I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.
But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them, find enough investors that this can be considered a success, there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring.
And those can be environmental bonds.
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds.
And before you know it, any social cause can be actually financed in this way.
Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.
But let's take the idea further.
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's, you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.
But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.
You can bring it to Asia.
You can, once you have all of those different points, you can make it easy for investors.
Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click.
Once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix.
What do investors get?
On one side financial, on the other side social.
So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency, Morningstar type.
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.
Now take it to the last step.
Once you have all of that put together, there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a marketplace for all of that, where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.
And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms, no blind people running around to find each other.
Thank you.

<title>Jonathan Harris: The Web's secret stories</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Jonathan Harris wants to make sense of the emotional world of the Web. With deep compassion for the human condition, his projects troll the Internet to find out what we're all feeling and looking for.</description>
So I really consider myself a storyteller.
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way, in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.
Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories, people all around the world.
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
I think people are very similar, but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps, and I think we all see a lot of gaps.
And we define ourselves by our gaps.
There's language gaps, there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps, there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps, there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps, there's also religious gaps.
You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something, some smaller community.
But I think that actually, despite our gaps, we really have a lot in common.
And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves.
I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.
But the thing about self-expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen.
This, also, is nothing new.
Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art, writing poems, singing songs, scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper, gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.
What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities, these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.
And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints, footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.
And so what I do is, I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints, and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them -- what they feel, what they think, what's different in the world today than usual, these sorts of questions.
One project that explores these ideas, which was made about a year ago, is a piece called We Feel Fine.
This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."
And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the sentence up to the period, and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.
Then, knowing the geographical location and the time, we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence.
All of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
It's been running for about a year and a half.
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.
What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles, each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours.
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside -- so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.
And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.
The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside, so that the large dots contain large sentences, and the small dots contain small sentences.
Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here, "I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions.
And all of these are stated by people: "I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much, but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond, it's nice to feel bigger again."
The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics, and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.
And then they also exhibit curiosity.
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words. Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.
There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.
And I'll walk you through a few of those now.
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order, they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
"I feel a bit better now."
"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."
"I feel gypped out of something awesome here."
"I feel so free; I feel so good."
"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."
And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected. And in that way, you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy.
The next movement is called Montage.
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours, if you will.
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.
We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."
These are automatically constructed using the found objects: "I think I feel a little full."
The next movement is called mobs.
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.
We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now, followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.
We can also get a gender breakdown.
And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.
We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram of the world's emotional distribution by age.
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific, followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties, and it dies out very quickly from there.
In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent, so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they're part of the sun.
The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.
The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm, and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.
We see that the world is feeling "used" at 3.3 times the normal level right now.
They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.
Other views are also available.
Here are gender, age, weather, location.
The final movement is called Mounds.
It's a bit different from the others.
Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle.
And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."
And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll, and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
You can see the little pink cursor moving along, representing our position.
Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."
There's also a search capability, if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.
For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted" in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.
But I'll spare you that.
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected: "I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."
"I feel very lonely."
"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful."
"I feel invisible to you."
"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."
"I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty."
"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."
"I love how I feel today."
So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call "passive observation."
What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing, and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.
And because of that, you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses that are often very moving.
And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people don't know they're being interviewed.
They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.
Another technique is directly questioning people.
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project, the Yahoo! Time Capsule, which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
It was divided into ten very simple themes -- love, anger, sadness and so on -- each of which contained a single, very open-ended question put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
The time capsule was available for one month online, translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
It's a spinning globe, the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule.
The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.
You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.
This is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World."
There are two modes to the time capsule.
There's One World, which presents the spinning globe, and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one.
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event, which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights, the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls, which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.
And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier -- the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more, and saw these images go across the rocks, I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again.
You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss, the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.
And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away, where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.
And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky, and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories.
You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up, I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.
And as an adult, I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.
Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.
I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.
And it caused me to wonder about our world today.
And it caused me to wonder specifically, if we could make new constellations today, what would those look like? What would those be?
If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
What are the great stories of today?
And those are the questions that inspired my new project, which is debuting here today at TED.
Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.
It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.
And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.
So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.
So, Universe will open here.
And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field, and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background, kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom, and we'll put it down here to red.
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.
Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody, an image, a news story, a person, a company. You know, some kind of heroic personality.
And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.
We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.
And we see here a photograph with a head.
You can start to see words emerging here.
And those are the constellations of today.
And I can turn them all on, and you can see them moving across the sky now.
This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.
The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world.
It's using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York, actually, called Daylife.
And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.
So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford, Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words -- I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently.
President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.
We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe, and everything else will enter its orbit.
So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it.
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.
We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe.
Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.
We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.
In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely, and you can just kind of click on stuff.
This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.
So, if we want to, let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.
And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton.
We can have his constellations emerge here.
We can pull out his secrets, and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates, Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.
We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.
Any of those can be opened up.
So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.
You can see that this is an important story; there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up, we get different perspectives on this story.
You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.
We can also see the superstars. These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary, Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby -- these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.
We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.
We can see he's been focused in America because he's been campaigning, probably, but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.
And then we can also see a timeline.
So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday, but he was back to work on Sunday morning, and actually been tapering off since then this week.
And it's not limited to just people or dates, but we can actually put in concepts also.
So if I put in climate change for all of 2006, we'll see what that universe looks like.
Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.
Here we have our secrets.
So we see again, climate change is large: Nairobi, global conference, environmental.
And there are also quotes that you can see, if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.
You know, this is really an infinite thing.
The superstars of climate change in 2006: United States, Britain, China. You know, these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.
So this is a piece that demands exploration.
This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be.
You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe -- it supports both the notion of a global mythology, which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007, and also a personal mythology.
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world, and then see what the constellations of those might look like.
So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.

<title>Howard Rheingold: The new power of collaboration</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Howard Rheingold talks about the coming world of collaboration, participatory media and collective action -- and how Wikipedia is really an outgrowth of our natural human instinct to work as a group.</description>
I'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.
Here is the old story -- we've already heard a little bit about it: biology is war in which only the fiercest survive; businesses and nations succeed only by defeating, destroying and dominating competition; politics is about your side winning at all costs.
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines, in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role.
And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room.
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs," and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
In fact, if you look back, human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.
Humans have lived for much, much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.
And we don't know exactly how they did this, although they must have solved some collective action problems; it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups.
And again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms.
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families?
And if so, how did they make arrangements?
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved.
Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations, the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.
And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks; marks on clay in that time.
Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.
And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years, for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires.
And then another communication technology enabled new media: the printing press came along, and within decades, millions of people became literate.
And from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion and politics.
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation, constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
Not created by the printing press, but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.
Now, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.
But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old, enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies, such as the joint-stock ownership company, shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.
Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet, and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press, a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.
Evolution is speeding up.
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops, and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of the human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today.
Now, when I started looking into collective action, the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them: the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.
Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma, so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later.
The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war: two players who couldn't trust each other.
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.
Person with the goods, person with the money, because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.
Neither one wants to be the first one or they're going to get the sucker's payoff, but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
Here's how the game is played: there are two players; they've never played the game before, they will not play the game again, they don't know each other, and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.
First player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10, whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split -- both players are paid and the game is over -- or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.
Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students, a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.
And although they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before, proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.
Now, the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered, to their surprise, that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures -- each had radically different ideas of what is fair.
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or not.
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.
He had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it.
Now, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in 1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask, which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?
So she went out and looked at what data she could find.
She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds, forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case, humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma; in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
They escape by creating institutions for collective action.
And she discovered, I think most interestingly, that among those institutions that worked, there were a number of common design principles, and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work.
I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis, group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned.
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.
In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.
And most recently, neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain.
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together.
Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms.
Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent; socialism emerged as a reaction to that.
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth, we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones.
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun -- some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.
Eli Lilly -- in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace, treats them as a network and trains them to produce better, even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism; they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves," it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world, including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now: it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it, illiterates can be trained to use it.
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making the system more efficient the more it is used.
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the Internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that's Folding@home at Stanford -- to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.
I don't think we know enough yet.
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are, but I think we can begin to think about them.
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them, but think about self-interest.
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
In the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world, citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.
Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
I believe that the payoff would be very big.
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines.
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things -- but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago, people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.
Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease, suffering was alleviated.
What forms of suffering could be alleviated, what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation?
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen; it's going to require effort.
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.
Thank you.

<title>Gordon Brown: Wiring a web for global good</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We're at a unique moment in history, says UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown: we can use today's interconnectedness to develop our shared global ethic -- and work together to confront the challenges of poverty, security, climate change and the economy.</description>
Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall?
This is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl, her back ruined by napalm, and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America to begin to end the Vietnam War.
This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980s, 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued, and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.
This is Tiananmen Square.
A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.
This next is the Sudanese girl, a few moments from death, a vulture hovering in the background, a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty.
This is Neda, the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so, of the YouTube generation.
And what do all these pictures and events have in common?
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see.
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community.
What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others, however distantly.
What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.
What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths, across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others, and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted, see injuries that need to be corrected, see problems that need to be rectified.
There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister, going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said -- and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister -- "Isn’t this man a communist?"
The reply was, "No, Mr President, he’s an anti-communist."
And Ronald Reagan said, "I don’t care what kind of communist he is!"
Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme, the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, "Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?"
He said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full.
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith, and people of no faith.
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world.
We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society.
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.
They protested across Britain.
They won public opinion over a long period of time.
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people’s hearts and minds?
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb, the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria, that in Britain she wanted to take action, but she had to go house to house, leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children, an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.
But what more could she have done if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately?
Now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years.
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime, eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text."
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out, a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs told the world that there was a repression, meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi, who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world, had to be listened to.
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today: following what happened to Neda, people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging, changing their address to Tehran, Iran, and making it difficult for the security services.
Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of: the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally.
That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world.
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites; it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging, who are communicating with each other around the world.
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people, children, had the right to education.
100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid, discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.
I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London.
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so -- when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage.
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.
Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.
My husband too has spent a long time in prison."
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all.
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead, the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society.
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.
Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face, most of which are global in their nature.
Climate change cannot be solved in one country, but has got to be solved by the world working together.
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone; it needed the world to work together.
Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally, the problem of human rights and development: they cannot be solved by Africa alone; they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together.
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me, is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together, a truly global society, built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future.
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem?
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda.
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations.
Take the financial crisis.
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.
If people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain, and people's ordinary savings are affected by it, then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth, for jobs, as well as for financial stability, global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared, and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future, and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done.
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.
This is a country of six and a half million people, but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses; it has 120 midwives.
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources.
Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania, a girl called Miriam.
She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS, her mother and then her father.
She was an AIDS orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for.
She herself was suffering from HIV; she was suffering from tuberculosis.
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.
When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future, but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment, I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture, so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.
Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world.
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy, in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent.
In the Rwanda Children's Museum, there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.
There is a photograph of a boy called David.
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.
It said "David, age 10."
David: ambition to be a doctor.
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?
Making people laugh.
How did he die?
Tortured to death.
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death: "Don't worry. The United Nations are coming."
And we never did.
And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda, and we never did.
So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.
So my argument today is basically this.
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.
It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences, people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."
But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences, people turned to each other and didn’t say "Great speech."
They said, "Let's march."
We should be marching towards a global society.
Thank you.

<title>Oliver Sacks: What hallucination reveals about our minds</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Neurologist and author Oliver Sacks brings our attention to Charles Bonnet syndrome -- when visually impaired people experience lucid hallucinations. He describes the experiences of his patients in heartwarming detail and walks us through the biology of this under-reported phenomenon.</description>
We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well.
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination.
And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination, our inscapes. We've lived with them all our lives.
But there are also hallucinations as well, and hallucinations are completely different.
They don't seem to be of our creation.
They don't seem to be under our control.
They seem to come from the outside, and to mimic perception.
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations, and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients.
A few months ago, I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work.
They told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s, was seeing things, and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers or, because she was an old lady, whether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.
And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie, the old lady.
I went in to see her.
It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence, but she'd been very startled and very bewildered, because she'd been seeing things.
And she told me -- the nurses hadn't mentioned this -- that she was blind, that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.
But now, for the last few days, she'd been seeing things.
So I said, "What sort of things?"
And she said, "People in Eastern dress, in drapes, walking up and down stairs.
A man who turns towards me and smiles.
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.
Animals too.
I see a white building. It's snowing, a soft snow.
I see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away.
Then, one night, the scene changes.
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.
They come to a certain point and then stop.
Then it changes again.
I see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs.
They wear bright colors, rose and blue, like Eastern dress."
Sometimes, she said, before the people come on, she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor, which seem to go up to the ceiling.
I said, "Is this like a dream?"
And she said, "No, it's not like a dream. It's like a movie."
She said, "It's got color. It's got motion.
But it's completely silent, like a silent movie."
And she said that it's a rather boring movie.
She said, "All these people with Eastern dress, walking up and down, very repetitive, very limited."
And she has a sense of humor.
She knew it was a hallucination.
But she was frightened. She'd lived 95 years and she'd never had a hallucination before.
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing, that they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear.
She had no control over them.
She said she didn't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations.
And none of the people or the animals, well, they all seemed oblivious of her.
And she didn't know what was going on.
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind.
Well, I examined her carefully.
She was a bright old lady, perfectly sane. She had no medical problems.
She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.
But she was blind.
And I then said to her, "I think I know what you have."
I said, "There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.
This was originally described," I said, "right back in the 18th century, by a man called Charles Bonnet.
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.
There is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind.
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
And she was very relieved at this, that there was nothing seriously the matter, and also rather curious.
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"
She said, "Did he have them himself?"
And she said, "Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
Well, so I did tell the nurses.
Now this, for me, is a common situation.
I work in old-age homes, largely.
I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired.
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations.
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations.
You don't have to be completely blind, only sufficiently impaired.
Now with the original description in the 18th century, Charles Bonnet did not have them.
His grandfather had these hallucinations.
His grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.
He'd had cataract surgery.
His vision was pretty poor.
And in 1759, he described to his grandson various things he was seeing.
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair.
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles.
And he knew it was a hallucination.
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not, because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions.
So on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them, he said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."
And then the handsome young men disappeared.
It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.
They don't usually fade in and out.
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.
Charles Lullin, the grandfather, saw hundreds of different figures, different landscapes of all sorts.
On one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe, and realized it was himself.
That was the only figure he recognized.
On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris, he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.
But when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high, on his study table.
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia.
With him and with Rosalie, what seems to be going on -- and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" -- and I said that as you lose vision, as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input, they become hyperactive and excitable, and they start to fire spontaneously.
And you start to see things.
The things you see can be very complicated indeed.
With another patient of mine, who, also had some vision, the vision she had could be disturbing.
On one occasion, she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.
And he turned around. And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts, who started walking towards her.
And then the six figures came together again, like a concertina.
Once, when she was driving, or rather, her husband was driving, the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.
She had very mobile hallucinations as well.
A lot of them had to do with a car.
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car.
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned.
And then when they came to a stop, the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air, and then disappear.
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination.
This was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes, but the visual parts of her brain, a little tumor in the occipital cortex.
And, above all, she would see cartoons.
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field, like a screen.
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog.
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street, but she made a point of saying, "Why Kermit?" she said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.
You know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants.
Why Kermit?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed, with very large teeth or very large eyes.
And these frightened her.
Well, what is going on with these people?
As a physician, I have to try and define what's going on, and to reassure people, especially to reassure them that they're not going insane.
Something like 10 percent, as I said, of visually impaired people get these.
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them, because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.
And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed.
In particular, the notion is that if you see things or hear things, you're going mad, but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different.
Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal, they address you. They accuse you.
They seduce you. They humiliate you.
They jeer at you.
You interact with them.
There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.
There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you, or that's how people think about it.
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy, and sometimes, if one has this, one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past.
You're at a particular road junction.
You smell chestnuts roasting.
You hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.
And you're waiting for your girl.
And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations, full of feeling, full of familiarity, located in space and time, coherent, dramatic.
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations, you have all sorts of levels, from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces.
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces, are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations.
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.
So, what is going on?
Fascinatingly, in the last few years, it's been possible to do functional brain imagery, to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating.
And in fact, to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating.
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations, the primary visual cortex is activated.
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.
You don't form images with your primary visual cortex.
When images are formed, a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe.
And in particular, one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus.
And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus, they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces.
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus, they may hallucinate faces, and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented, and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations.
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons.
It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.
It's very interesting that that should be specific.
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes.
Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain, but particular cells.
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells, which can be very, very specific.
So you may not only have "car" cells, you may have "Aston Martin" cells.
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.
I had to bring it in.
And now it's in there somewhere.
Now, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex, there are only visual images, or figments or fragments.
It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion.
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, you don't go to those higher levels.
You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images, or figments, or fragmentary figments, all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells.
Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception, or imagination, and one is not conscious of them.
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted.
And instead of getting normal perception, you're getting an anarchic, convulsive stimulation, or release, of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex.
So, suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car.
Suddenly this, and suddenly that.
The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this, but not terribly successfully.
When these were first described, it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.
But in fact people say, "I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations."
"Kermit means nothing to me."
You don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams.
Well, I've more or less said what I wanted.
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common.
Think of the number of blind people.
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations, but are too scared to mention them.
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice, for patients, for doctors, for the public.
Finally, I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable, for giving one some insight as to how the brain works.
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago -- he wondered how, thinking these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain.
Now, 250 years later, I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.
Thanks very much.
Chris Anderson: That was superb. Thank you so much.
You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients.
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.
Well, yeah, a lot of them.
And actually I'm a little visually impaired myself.
I'm blind in one eye, and not terribly good in the other.
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.
But they stop there.
CA: And they don't disturb you?
Because you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried?
OS: Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus, which I ignore.
They occasionally interest me, and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.
I've gone and had an fMRI myself, to see how my visual cortex is taking over.
And when I see all these hexagons and complex things, which I also have, in visual migraine, I wonder whether everyone sees things like this, and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit.
CA: That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.
Thank you so much for sharing.
OS: Thank you. Thank you.

<title>Bart Weetjens: How I taught rats to sniff out land mines</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: No one knows exactly how many landmines still litter the world, but it's safe to say: millions, waiting to kill and maim unsuspecting civilians. Clearing them is slow, expensive and dangerous. The founder of Apopo, Bart Weetjens, talks about his extraordinary project: training rats to sniff out land mines. He shows clips of his "hero rats" in action, and previews his work's next phase: teaching them to turn up tuberculosis in the lab.</description>
I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis.
As a child, I had two passions.
One was a passion for rodents.
I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels.
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.
I also had a passion for Africa.
Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity.
Africa was truly fascinating for me.
I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries.
I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode.
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines.
We're talking '95 now.
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true.
As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land.
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world.
We chose rats.
Why would you choose rats?
Because, aren't they vermin?
Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures.
And actually, our product -- what you see here.
There's a target somewhere here.
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right.
There, the animal finds a mine.
It scratches on the soil.
And the animal comes back for a food reward.
Very, very simple.
Very sustainable in this environment.
Here, the animal gets its food reward.
And that's how it works.
Very, very simple.
Now why would you use rats?
Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments.
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species.
They're extremely sensitive to smell.
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it.
Now how do we communicate with rats?
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there.
A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat.
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets.
In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields.
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test.
This consists of 400 square meters.
There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets.
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way.
Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog.
This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows.
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.
They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid.
Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up.
But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down.
Question of scale.
If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger.
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology.
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines.
But let me bring you to a very different problem.
And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection.
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem.
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.
It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.
And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.
You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives.
So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B.
is "tering," which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar.
Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients.
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row.
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology.
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there.
So how does it work?
You have a cassette with 10 samples.
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.
Here it's already at the third sample.
This is a positive sample.
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.
And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative.
Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only.
A cage like this -- A cage like this -- provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples.
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.
I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done.
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent.
Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent.
So this is really considerable.
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives.
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology.
And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds.
So, to standardize this.
Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people.
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on.
This is in a prototype stage.
We don't have a working system here yet.
To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people.
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available.
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human.
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world.
Thank you very much.

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Novelist Amy Tan digs deep into the creative process, looking for hints of how hers evolved.</description>
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.
And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the TED commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity.
OK.
So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.
And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new.
And that includes nature, and nurture, and what I refer to as nightmares.
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something, perhaps in our brains, some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect.
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives.
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different.
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else?
And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.
And I had a miniature poodle.
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words.
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure.
But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father, six months later, had brain tumors.
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles, and that God's will would take care of that.
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.
There was a reason for everything.
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother, who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.
And so, I had this notion of death all around me, because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon, you begin to think very much about everything.
You become very creative, in a survival sense.
And this, then, led to my big questions.
And they're the same ones that I have today.
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen. What are the influences?
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe, as the creator of that universe.
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out -- years and years, oftentimes.
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on.
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association: quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand, but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor.
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.
And this happens constantly in the writing.
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about. And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about.
You won't discover anything.
And what you were supposed to find, what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way, is no longer there.
Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have.
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
And they all operate at the same time.
There is also a big question of ambiguity.
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.
It is constantly there. And, just as an example, this is one that recently came to me.
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said, "Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.
So, there was another one that I came across, and it's "saving fish from drowning."
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation, and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me: "save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.
OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning, or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
And then we have intentions.
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do, and then we do something.
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?
What are we supposed to do?
Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called "Saving Fish From Drowning."
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.
I got these hints everywhere.
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues, and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.
And when I have the question, it is a focus.
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
And it seems like it's happening all the time.
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity, in which you're getting all this help from the universe.
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
And you are noticing it more often.
But you apply this.
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?
Why or why not?
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma.
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show that I approved of the military regime there.
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself, "Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us?"
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up, and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father, who was a Baptist minister.
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals, so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at, and we talked about today, is genocide.
This leads to this question.
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe?
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary.
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally, from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time, I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself, and that actually was the way it happened.
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.
There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
In this case, I was writing a story that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.
And I took down this book, and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period, and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion, happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that, and a character who thought he was the son of God.
You wonder, are these things random chance?
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
And that goes into the story, too.
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
Especially when good things happen, and, in particular, when bad things happen.
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine.
And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later, walking along the beach, I came across this.
And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story, and I cannot explain it.
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things?
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
What is the nature of accidents?
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are, outside of a court of law?
I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China.
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep, and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.
Responsibility was assigned to the family.
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.
It's the son, not the father."
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.
And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
And how do I create my own life?
And I think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point.
I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before.
So, there are never complete answers.
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new.
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me, it is to simply imagine.
And to imagine is to put myself in that story, until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think, to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
Because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.
We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.
There she is.
Thank you very much!

<title>Andrew Fitzgerald: Adventures in Twitter fiction</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the 1930s, broadcast radio introduced an entirely new form of storytelling; today, micro-blogging platforms like Twitter are changing the scene again. Andrew Fitzgerald takes a look at the short but fascinating history of new forms of creative experimentation in fiction and storytelling.</description>
So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools.
And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast.
And from those single points emanated stories.
And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium.
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.
Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format.
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.
And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world.
This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them.
There are thousands upon thousands of them.
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster.
We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods.
The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called "Wool."
And he actually says that he didn't intend for "Wool" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more.
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one, "Wool 3," which was even longer, culminating in "Wool 5," which was a 60,000-word novel.
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books.
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order.
There was no mediator between him and the audience.
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him.
So this whole project was an experiment.
It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format.
And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called "Black Box."
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind.
Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created.
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.
Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.
Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
I think that's pretty exciting: tune-in literary fiction.
The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them.
They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."
It began with this tweet: "On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."
It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.
when this woman falls to her death.
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives.
One reviewer called Elliott's story "Twitter fiction done right," because she did.
She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
Interestingly, though, it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism.
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.
Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line.
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world.
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous "binders full of women" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing," including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world.
They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress.
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.
And they engage with the real world.
They respond to it.
So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account.
It was Mayor Emanuel.
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department.
This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went.
It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird.
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is -- it didn't actually happen.
I double checked the newspapers.
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account.
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.
One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.
Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show.
Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird.
And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.
He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text.
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new.
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way.
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.
Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day.
And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news.
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.
So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks.
They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.
Thank you.

<title>Ananda Shankar Jayant: Fighting cancer with dance</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Renowned classical Indian dancer Ananda Shankar Jayant was diagnosed with cancer in 2008. She tells her personal story of not only facing the disease but dancing through it, and gives a performance revealing the metaphor of strength that helped her do it.</description>
[Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children.
I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee.
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance.
Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards.
The crowning glory was in 2007, when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, for my contribution to art.
But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008.
I heard the word "carcinoma."
Yes, breast cancer.
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade."
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school.
That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner.
As a dancer, I know the nine rasas or the navarasas: anger, valor, disgust, humor and fear.
I thought I knew what fear was.
That day, I learned what fear was.
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control, I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
Is this the end of my dance?"
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best."
I realized then that I, who thought I had complete control of my life, had control of only three things: My thought, my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it.
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
So I dried my tears, and I declared to the world at large ...
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out, and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something.
I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there.
And I found that in my dance, my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion, my very life breath.
But it wasn't easy.
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days?
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have.
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio, and learn everything I learned when I was four, all over again, reworked, relearned, regrouped.
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
Difficult.
I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself.
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind.
But I needed something else.
I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga.
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful, her 18 arms ready for warfare, as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti.
Durga, the fearless one.
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own.
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training, I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance, laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule.
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks, obstacles and challenges that life throws at you.
My story is the power of thought.
My story is the power of choice.
It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
My story is the power of a metaphor.
It's the power of an image.
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one.
She was also called Simhanandini, the one who rode the lion.
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, my own inner resilience, armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror.
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini."

<title>Spencer Wells: A family tree for humanity</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: All humans share some common bits of DNA, passed down to us from our African ancestors. Geneticist Spencer Wells talks about how his Genographic Project will use this shared DNA to figure out how we are -- in all our diversity -- truly connected.</description>
Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks, as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing, checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.
And visiting some pretty incredible places, places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice -- I was here a month ago.
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.
You see some incredible stuff.
And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe.
And the thing that you really take away from that, the kind of surface thing that you take away from it, is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that, but rather how different we are.
There is so much diversity around the globe.
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes.
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that, and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.
How do we explain that diversity?
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took.
Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions.
And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.
First one is really a question of origins.
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?
When did we originate as a species?
How long have we been divergent from each other?
And the second question is related, but slightly different.
If we do spring from a common source, how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe, and in the process generate all of this diversity, the different ways of life, the different appearances, the different languages around the world?
Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology, seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote, "In each great region of the world, the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere."
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes.
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.
Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time, due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago, and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.
The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia, became the gibbons and the orangutans.
And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.
So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes, it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.
But that's not really the question I'm asking.
I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room.
If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?
Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.
How do we study that?
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.
Digging things up out of the ground, and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying, "This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.
This must be who I'm directly descended from."
The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue, gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry, but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.
What do I mean by that?
You're looking at a great example here.
These are three extinct species of hominids, potential human ancestors.
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.
From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei, the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again, largely skull shape.
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet.
You think you've got a tough job?
And he did a pretty good job.
He categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae."
He actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, "Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans, and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus," which basically included all the people he didn't like, including imaginary folk like elves.
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era.
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity.
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago -- Carlton Coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era -- for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.
But based on what data?
Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.
Well, what I'm going to talk about today, what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry, digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors, and saying it on the basis of morphology -- which we still don't completely understand, we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation -- what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem, or a genealogical question.
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
And as any genealogist will tell you -- anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.
You gradually trace further and further back into the past, adding these ever more distant relationships.
But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records, and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.
A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors, and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.
Who were these people who came before?
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code -- we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.
Now, a quick primer on DNA.
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long.
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body, and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back, thousands of times. It's a lot of information.
And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.
Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."
Now multiply it by 100.
And imagine copying that by hand.
And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake -- substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.
But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down through the generations, they become markers of descent.
If you share a marker with someone, it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past, the person who first had that change in their DNA.
And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation, the pattern of these markers in people all over the world, and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history, that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother, all the way back to the very first woman.
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent.
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world, falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.
Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.
What's the take-home message?
Well, the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa, among Africans.
That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer.
And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.
Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person -- Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa, an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.
But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago.
That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.
This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.
It's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.
Such an amazing story.
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?
Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species, or sub-species rather, human races around the world?
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?
Well, that's a big question. These "why" questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones, the ones that are tough to answer.
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather.
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.
Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.
New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.
Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.
Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn -- and there aren't a lot of glaciers here, except on the high mountains here in East Africa.
So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.
This is a paleo-climatological map of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.
If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.
So the whole world was drying out.
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today.
The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago, crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.
We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.
And then something happened. A great illustration of it.
Look at some stone tools.
The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.
The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins, not our direct ancestors, living in Europe, and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience, basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
The tool styles don't change that much.
The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period.
But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.
The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species, at particular times of the year.
The population size started to expand.
Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object -- that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.
We became much more social. The social networks expanded.
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.
Well, you want the ultimate African success story?
Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now, around 60, 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.
These would have been savannah hunters.
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.
And it's basically a meat locker.
People who would have specialized in killing the animals, hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up, following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago, during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on.
And when they reached Central Asia, they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway, a grassland super-highway.
The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age -- stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea, and the entire continent was open to them.
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps -- migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.
An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.
The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.
Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.
And as we were finishing up that film -- it was co-produced with National Geographic -- I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, "You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level.
What do you want to do next?"
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.
It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.
And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from, you know, a handful of populations around the world.
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.
We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more -- hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."
And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.
The project launched in April 2005.
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost.
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.
I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.
Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.
That's the focus of the field research, the centers that we've set up all over the world -- 10 of them, top population geneticists.
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.
In this case, you actually can.
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.
And you can actually submit those results to the database, and tell us a little about your genealogical background, have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.
Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise, after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components, gets plowed back into the project.
The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects, and I'll show you a couple of examples.
So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world.
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone, preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza, language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.
So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.
Thank you very much.

<title>Thomas Dolby: "Love Is a Loaded Pistol"</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: To write his first studio album in decades, "A Map of the Floating City," Thomas Dolby has been working in the inspirational setting of a restored lifeboat. At TED2010 he premieres a gorgeous, evocative song from that album -- about one night with a legend. He's backed by members of the modern string quartet Ethel.</description>
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own.
And that was largely because there weren't any.
So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.
A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England.
And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.
During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast.
So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power.
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs.
I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.
It's about Billie Holiday.
And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning.
But I know where she was.
She was with me on my lifeboat.
And she was hot.
♫ Billie crept softly ♫ ♫ into my waking arms ♫ ♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫ ♫ Strange fruit for ♫ ♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫ ♫ Panic at the stage door ♫ ♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫ ♫ "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" ♫ ♫ Must have left the building ♫ ♫ body and soul ♫ ♫ On a creaky ♫ ♫ piano stool tonight ♫ ♫ as the moon is my ♫ ♫ only witness ♫ ♫ She was breathing ♫ ♫ in my ear ♫ ♫ "This time it's love" ♫ ♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫ ♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫ ♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫ ♫ See in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ Stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ Billie, time, ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ Still an echo ♫ ♫ in my heart says, ♫ ♫ "This time it's love" ♫

<title>Jeremy Gilley: One day of peace</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Here's a crazy idea: Persuade the world to try living in peace for just one day, every September 21. In this energetic, honest talk, Jeremy Gilley tells the story of how this crazy idea became real -- real enough to help millions of kids in war-torn regions.</description>
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.
I couldn't understand the starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people.
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do.
And when I was 12, I became an actor.
I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.
I was told I was dyslexic.
In fact, I have got qualifications.
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful, obviously.
And so concern is where all of this comes from.
And then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things, and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in really wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more.
And at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby, this wonderful nuclear physicist, and he said that media had a responsibility, that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward.
And that fascinated me, because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.
And then I thought, well maybe I could do something.
Maybe I could become a filmmaker.
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference.
Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in.
So I started thinking about peace, and I was obviously, as I said to you, very much moved by these images, trying to make sense of that.
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on?
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.
But I realized that, having been messing around with structure as an actor, that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough, that there needed to be a mountain to climb, there needed to be a journey that I had to take.
And if I took that journey, no matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.
The point was that I would have something to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil?
Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children?
Is that a responsible thing to do? Etc., etc.
So I was thinking about peace, and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?
And that was when I had the idea.
There was no starting point for peace.
There was no day of global unity.
There was no day of intercultural cooperation.
There was no day when humanity came together, separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we're in this together, and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated, then that might be the key to humanity's survival.
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day.
So obviously we didn't have any money.
I was living at my mom's place.
And we started writing letters to everybody.
You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do to fathom that out.
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day, the 21st of September?
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad's favorite number.
He was a prisoner of war.
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.
It poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.
So he was like my hero.
And the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left, 23 came back, two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.
So we began this journey, and we launched it in 1999.
And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors, Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths, various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody.
And very quickly, some letters started coming back.
And we started to build this case.
And I remember the first letter.
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.
And of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying, "This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.
I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."
And we didn't have money for the flight.
And I rang Sir Bob Ayling, who was CEO of BA at the time, and said, "Mate, we've got this invitation.
Could you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him."
And of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.
And actually, let me go back to that slide, because when we launched it in 1999 -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people.
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people, lots of people -- all the press, because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.
And we invited everybody, and no press showed up.
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family.
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing.
But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.
For me, it was really about the process.
It wasn't about the end result.
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera.
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is.
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually.
So anyway, we began the journey.
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.
I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long, because every time I saw Kofi Annan, I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it, and that was kind of what was going on.
Yeah, I'm not worried about it now.
So Mary Robinson, she said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created."
Kofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground."
The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim, said, "I must get the African countries involved."
Dr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate, president now of Costa Rica, said, "I'll do everything that I can."
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks, and so on and so on and so on -- while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense.
And then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.
76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.
And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone.
I've recorded 44,000 young people.
I've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.
I'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry, their art, their literature, their music, their sport, whatever it might be.
And we were listening to everybody.
And it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.
and working with NGOs and building this case.
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day.
And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was, the better chance we had of creating this day.
And it was this stuff, this, where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.
It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.
The fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work, then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic, and that young boy who was a child soldier, who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop.
And that actually, at that moment something happened to me, which obviously made me go, "I'm going to document.
If this is the only film that I ever make, I'm going to document until this becomes a reality."
Because we've got to stop, we've got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that, as a young person, is confusing me.
I don't know how to get involved in that process.
And then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York.
The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly, with 54 co-sponsors, the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day, the 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date, and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.
Yeah, but there were hundreds of individuals, obviously, who made that a reality.
And thank you to all of them.
That was an incredible moment.
I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen.
And as I mentioned, when it started, we were at the Globe, and there was no press.
And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story."
And suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day.
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th to do a press conference.
And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.
And I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way.
And obviously he never came down. The statement was never made.
The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence.
And it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives, there and then subsequently all over the world.
It never happened.
And I remember thinking, "This is exactly why, actually, we have to work even harder.
And we have to make this day work.
It's been created; nobody knows.
But we have to continue this journey, and we have to tell people, and we have to prove it can work."
And I left New York freaked, but actually empowered.
And I felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.
I was showing the film, and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.
It's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan; the Taliban won't listen, etc., etc.
It's just symbolism.
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways, because it couldn't not work.
I'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank, India, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was, and they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity, we can move aid, we can vaccinate children.
Children can lead their projects.
They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved."
That's what I'd heard.
And I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about.
And so I went back to the United Nations.
I decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie.
And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years.
We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system, governments and NGOs, trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it, see if we could make it possible.
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously, I'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi, one of my heroes and mentors really, he managed to get UNICEF involved.
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go."
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.
It was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan with UNAMA and WHO and civil society, etc., etc., etc.?
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it, and I was thinking, "This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working.
But even if it doesn't, at least the door is open and there's a chance."
And so I went back to London, and I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.
And I saw him because he was an actor, I was an actor, I had a connection to him, because we needed to get to the press, we needed this attraction, we needed the media to be involved.
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas, maybe there would be more people interested.
And maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more, which had been desperately difficult.
I won't go into that.
So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you."
While I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?"
I said, "I'm going to go to Afghanistan." He said, "Really?"
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.
So I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?
It'd be really interesting if you came.
It would help and bring attention.
And that attention would help leverage the situation, as well as all of the other sides of it."
I think there's a number of pillars to success.
One is you've got to have a great idea.
The other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance, and you've got to be able to raise awareness.
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved.
So these guys were absolutely crucial.
So he said yes, and we found ourselves in Afghanistan.
It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there, I was talking to various people, and they were saying to me, "You've got to get everybody involved here.
You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work."
And we did, and we traveled around, and we spoke to elders, we spoke to doctors, we spoke to nurses, we held press conferences, we went out with soldiers, we sat down with ISAF, we sat down with NATO, we sat down with the U.K. government.
I mean, we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education, holding these press conferences, which of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there.
There was an interest in what was going on.
This amazing woman, Fatima Gailani, was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere.
And she was really crucial in getting the message in.
And then we went home. We'd sort of done it.
We had to wait now and see what happened.
And I got home, and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban.
And that letter basically said, "We'll observe this day.
We will observe this day.
We see it as a window of opportunity.
And we will not engage. We're not going to engage."
And that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn't be kidnapped or killed.
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.
And days later, 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping.
And like the General Assembly, obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back.
We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.
We went back to Afghanistan, because the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.
But more importantly, we wanted to go back, because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.
They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real.
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say, "Look, you guys made this possible. And thank you very much."
And we gave the film over.
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing.
And then that year, that year, 2008, this ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th: "General Stanley McChrystal, commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan, announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of September."
They were saying they would stop.
And then there was this other statement that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety saying that, in Afghanistan, because of this work, the violence was down by 70 percent.
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least.
And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything.
And I remember being stuck in New York, this time because of the volcano, which was obviously much less harmful.
And I was there thinking about what was going on.
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent.
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do.
And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan, then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.
We have to go for a global truce.
We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce, go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities, both domestically and internationally, ever recorded.
That's exactly what we must do.
And on the 21st of September this year, we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process, to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.
And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.
And we'll globally link with government, inter-government, non-government, education, unions, sports.
And you can see the education box there.
We've got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce.
And obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help.
Linking up with the Olympics -- I went and saw Seb Coe. I said, "London 2012 is about truce.
Ultimately, that's what it's about."
Why don't we all team up? Why don't we bring truce to life?
Why don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce?
We'll make a new film about this process.
We'll utilize sport and football.
On the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played, from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.
So, utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action.
And ultimately, we have to try that.
We have to work together.
And when I stand here in front of all of you, and the people who will watch these things, I'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met, that there is a possibility that our world could unite, that we could come together as one, that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues, brought about by individuals.
I was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.
I think he's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics -- in Afghanistan, in Iraq.
He's an amazing man.
And I sat with him a few weeks ago.
And I said to him, "Mr. Brahimi, is this nuts, going for a global truce?
Is this possible? Is it really possible that we could do this?"
He said, "It's absolutely possible."
I said, "What would you do?
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system?"
He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals."
It's all about the individuals.
It's all about you and me.
It's all about partnerships.
It's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.
Because together, by working together, I seriously think we can start to change things.
And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is, who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal -- and he said, "I've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares, and one of them is white."
And it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear.
If you put one drop, one drop of something, in that water, it'll change it forever.
By working together, we can create peace one day.
Thank you TED. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

<title>Melinda Gates: What nonprofits can learn from Coca-Cola</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Melinda Gates makes a provocative case: What can nonprofits learn from mega-corporations like Coca-Cola, whose global network of marketers and distributors ensures that every remote village wants -- and can get -- an ice-cold Coke? Maybe this model could work for distributing health care, vaccinations, sanitation, even condoms ...</description>
One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world, And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places, I'm really struck by the things that we have in common.
They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful, to be healthy, and to have a successful life.
But I also see lots of poverty, and it's quite jarring, both in the scale and the scope of it.
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors, no running water, no electricity, and that's really what I see all over the world.
So in short, I'm startled by all the things that they don't have.
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola.
Coke is everywhere.
In fact, when I travel to the developing world, Coke feels ubiquitous.
And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, "We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations," you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places?
If they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.
But I think, as a community, we still have a lot to learn.
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day.
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week.
So why does this matter?
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector.
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola.
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product.
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent, and they do incredible marketing.
So let's start with the data.
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress.
They have this very continuous feedback loop.
They learn something, they put it back into the product, they put it back into the market.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
It's a lot like other consumer companies.
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola, and you have a 107 constituencies, you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold, whether it was a corner store, a supermarket or a pushcart.
So if sales start to drop, then the person can identify the problem and address the issue.
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.
In development, the evaluation comes at the very end of the project.
I've sat in a lot of those meetings, and by then, it is way too late to use the data.
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on, and then you an see your impact."
Real-time data turns on the lights.
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?
They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent.
Coke's been in Africa since 1928, but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets, because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world, which was a large truck rolling down the street.
And in Africa, the remote places, it's hard to find a good road.
But Coke noticed something -- they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
And they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs, giving them small loans.
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers, and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people, who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product.
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa.
In Tanzania and Uganda, they represent 90 percent of Coke's sales.
Let's look at the development side.
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke?
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well, because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors, and they know what motivates them to make change.
I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program.
The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic, they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it, to get to the health care center.
They decided that wasn't good enough, so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this, and they adapted it for Ethiopia.
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country.
They trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people.
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people.
Now, think about how this can change people's lives.
Health extension workers can help with so many things, whether it's family planning, prenatal care, immunizations for the children, or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery.
That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia, and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008.
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program.
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?
Well, they're already starting talk about this.
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas?
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages?"
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential.
The third component of Coke's success is marketing.
Ultimately, Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola.
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing?
Well, it's aspirational.
It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live.
So even though it's a global company, they take a very local approach.
Coke's global campaign slogan is "Open Happiness."
But they localize it.
And they don't just guess what makes people happy; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life.
And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect.
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
K'Naan: ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫ ♫ Give you reason, take you higher ♫ ♫ See the champions take the field now ♫ ♫ You define us, make us feel proud ♫ ♫ In the streets our heads are lifted ♫ ♫ As we lose our inhibition ♫ ♫ Celebration, it's around us ♫ ♫ Every nation, all around us ♫ Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?
Well, they didn't stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages.
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries.
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," that also went number one on the pop charts.
Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity.
So how does health and development market?
Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations.
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.
And I think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption, that we think that, if people need something, we don't have to make them want that.
And I think that's a mistake.
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.
One example is sanitation.
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation.
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.
People reuse it for a slab for their home.
They sometimes store grain in it.
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.
But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?
Well, you work with the community.
You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village, and they agree to that.
But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern, trendy convenience.
One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship.
And it works -- look at these headlines.
I'm not kidding.
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.
No loo, no "I do."
Now, it's not just a funny headline -- it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.
But more importantly, it saves lives.
Take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband, Bill.
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?
They're waiting to be circumcised.
Can you you believe that?
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men.
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation, I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
But it turns out the men do, because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it, and the men also believe it improves their sex life.
So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development, we can change communities and we can change whole nations.
Well, why is all of this so important?
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together, when you tie the three things together.
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.
So if you look back to 1988, there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year.
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.
Well how did that happen?
Let's look at a country like India.
They have over a billion people in this country, but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis, and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.
They have two and a half million vaccinators.
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
Let me tell you the story of Shriram, an 18 month boy in Bihar, a northern state in India.
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
Now it could have come from one of two places.
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
Luckily, the genetic testing proved that, in fact, this strand came north, because, had it come from the south, it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
So many more people would have been affected.
So what's the endgame?
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio.
They went out and where Shriram lives, they vaccinated two million people.
So in less than a month, we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program.
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.
That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading, and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands; they can save lives.
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing, but it might not be what you think.
It's not the marketing on the ground.
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated."
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years, but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer.
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money.
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational, if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease, we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us.
And if we could do that, we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide, in all of our countries for polio.
And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet.
And we are so close.
And this victory is so possible.
So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness, I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms.
To me, that is deep happiness.
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector, then in the future we make together, that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola.
Thank you.

<title>JoAnn Kuchera-Morin: Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: JoAnn Kuchera-Morin demos the AlloSphere, a new way to see, hear and interpret scientific data. Dive into the brain, feel electron spin, hear the music of the elements ... and detect previously unseen patterns that could lead to new discoveries.</description>
The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere in an echo-free chamber.
Think of the AlloSphere as a large, dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer.
20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere, and be completely immersed in their data.
Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin.
Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material.
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain, as though it was a world, and see tissues as landscapes, and hear blood density levels as music.
This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.
But first a little bit about this group of artists, scientists, and engineers that are working together.
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained, and the inventor of the AlloSphere.
With my visual artist colleagues, we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space, visually and sonically.
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information.
And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration.
I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin.
This first project is called the AlloBrain.
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.
Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically.
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.
You see 12 intelligent computer agents, the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.
They're mining blood density levels.
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.
Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain.
They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.
We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation.
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth: very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.
For artists, we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore.
These generative algorithms grow over time, and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.
Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code, which are computer programs, that allow these creatures to grow over time.
We're going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world, down into the atomic world, as we fly into a lattice of atoms.
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.
They've discovered a new bond, a new material for transparent solar cells.
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms -- oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.
You view the bond in the triangle.
It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom.
You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists.
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.
The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms.
We've mapped them into the audio domain, so they're singing to you.
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.
We're going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom.
We're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration.
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration, and you're going to notice a pulsing.
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.
This is actually a light emitter.
As the sound starts to pulse and contract, our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.
They're starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations.
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.
We're going to move even further down, and go to one single electron spin.
This will be the final project that I show you.
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin.
We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it.
You're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow.
This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology.
So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to bring together, arts, science and engineering into a new age of math, science and art.
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.
Thank you very much.

<title>Ben Saunders: Why bother leaving the house?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Explorer Ben Saunders wants you to go outside! Not because it’s always pleasant and happy, but because that’s where the meat of life is, “the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.” Saunders’ next outdoor excursion? To try to be the first in the world to walk from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again.</description>
I essentially drag sledges for a living, so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually, but I'm going to read this question from an interview earlier this year: "Philosophically, does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving?
After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone, and we can participate virtually, then why bother leaving the house?"
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.
I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle, so I get out of the house a fair bit.
And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things, and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action that I'm going to try and explore briefly.
The pithiest answer to the question "why?"
that's been dogging me for the last 12 years was credited certainly to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back, second from the left, George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name.
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest.
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest, more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.
No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.
But he was credited with coining the phrase, "Because it's there."
Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.
There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say is actually far nicer, and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.
"The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this: What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?
And my answer must at once be, it is no use.
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.
Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation, but otherwise nothing will come of it.
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. So it is no use.
If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go.
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy, and joy, after all, is the end of life.
We don't live to eat and make money.
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.
That is what life means, and that is what life is for."
Mallory's argument that leaving the house, embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun, however, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.
The furthest I've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly what came over me, but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.
I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada.
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.
A lot of experts were saying it was impossible, and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea.
The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point, the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean, took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down, you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension, as I sat in a helicopter thundering north, and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.
There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.
I was 26. I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go, I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear.
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn, and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.
I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter.
Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.
The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea, so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies, about 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.
So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.
One of the magical things about this journey, however, is that because I'm walking over the sea, over this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.
The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around, refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever, possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.
I can try to tell you what it was like, but you'll never know what it was like, and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely, I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles, it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day, the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.
And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing, you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor, rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where the real meat of life is to be found, the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.
And I would add a cautionary note here, however.
In my experience, there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.
Now I don't just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do, but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer, there is something addictive about this, and in my case, I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit.
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it, but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on, to ruin every relationship I've ever had, so be careful what you wish for.
Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain, and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.
There is one unfinished challenge that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.
Many of you will know the story.
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole.
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica.
Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team, who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot, all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges, and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there, I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey.
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.
When I talk about Antarctica, people often say, "Hasn't, you know, that's interesting, hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"
Or, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.
Is there a chance you'll see her there?"
But Scott's journey remains unfinished.
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again.
It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration, and it seemed to me high time, given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job.
So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.
This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.
It will take us about four months to make this return journey.
That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.
We have to turn around and come back again.
I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before.
And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?"
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option.
If I wanted to know, for example, how many stars were in the Milky Way, how old those giant heads on Easter Island were, most of you could find that out right now without even standing up.
And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places, it is that true, real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge, from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown.
In life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to, and I think metaphorically speaking, at least, we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside.
Thank you very much.

<title>Adam Savage: My obsession with objects and the stories they tell</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Adam Savage talks about his fascination with the dodo bird, and how it led him on a strange and surprising double quest. It's an entertaining adventure through the mind of a creative obsessive.</description>
About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius.
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished, all within about 150 years.
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find, because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton.
See, while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody -- not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo.
Well, this isn't exactly true.
The fact is, is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified, skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal, they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire.
If you go look at their website today, they'll actually list these specimens, saying, the rest was lost in a fire.
Not quite the whole truth. Anyway.
The frontispiece of this article was this photo, and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker, because this photo completely rocked my world.
I became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself, the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there's an entire story here.
And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton?
I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell, and this was the very latest one.
So I began looking around for -- to see if anyone sold a kit, some kind of model that I could get, and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.
No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my "Creative Projects" folder -- it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.
Any time I have an internet connection, there's a sluice of stuff moving into there, everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille.
Russian nuclear launch key: The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay; the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself, because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.
Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth -- that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.
This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it's growing constantly.
And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids, and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.
I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought, maybe, yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.
I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor; I'm a hard-edged model maker.
You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate, you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" -- especially parts from "Star Wars" -- I can do this stuff all day long.
It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.
But you give me something like this -- my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this; it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" -- this is not my thing -- this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things.
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it -- I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.
So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.
I grabbed all the reference, and I found this lovely piece of reference.
This is someone selling this on eBay; it was clearly a woman’s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand, I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that, along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be, exactly how long, etc.
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton; I just noticed that as I finished this skull, the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.
I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.
And so button by button, vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.
And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull, a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.
And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference, every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.
This guy -- I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler.
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted, and I replicated every last bone and put it in.
And after about six weeks, I finished, painted, mounted my own dodo skeleton.
You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo.
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it -- a museum vitrine.
I don't have the room for this in my house, but I had to finish what I had started.
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.
Again, like I said, my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell, and also making them for myself, obtaining them, appreciating them and diving into them.
And in this folder, "Creative Projects," there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on, projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day, and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch.
But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different, that I -- you know, I have my own R2D2, but that's -- honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.
And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder, and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.
Now, this is funny for me: to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel, because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people, Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.
But in this case, it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story, it's about the object in and of itself.
And in this case, this object is -- plays on a host of levels.
First of all, there's the object in the world.
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."
It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count, and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.
Built out of words, it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie, in which another object is created: a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words, inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.
And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire.
And so now it was time to do some research.
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference.
But I discovered, in researching further, really wanting precise reference, that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in 1994, and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue, and in it I found this magnificent picture, which included a size reference.
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it.
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made.
It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial, Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this -- I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars -- they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom -- not just a front elevation, but also a side, rear and other side elevation.
So now, I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon.
What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.
So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull, I blew all my reference up to full size, and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references.
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it, and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail, I worked out and achieved -- working in front of the television and Super Sculpey -- here's me sitting next to my wife -- it's the only picture I took of the entire process.
As I moved through, I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.
But again, I am not a sculptor, and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like, I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey; I certainly wasn't able to get it.
So, I went down to my shop, and I molded it and I cast it in resin, because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.
Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.
My preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer.
I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell, but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass-smooth.
Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.
Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end, and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.
And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you, is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.
This is where it gets weird.
Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia.
Now, James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon, killed James Elroy's mother.
I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974, during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon," called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon -- one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie.
John's Grill, which actually is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon," is still a viable San Francisco eatery, counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook, who played Wilmer Cook in the movie, and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years, until it got stolen in January of 2007.
It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.
So here I had this Falcon, and it was lovely. It looked really great, the light worked on it really well, it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world.
But there was a problem. And the problem was that: I wanted the entirety of the object, I wanted the weight behind the object.
This thing was made of resin and it was too light.
There's this group online that I frequent.
It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade, make and travel in information about movie props.
And it turned out that one of the guys there, a friend of mine that I never actually met, but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.
He took my master Falcon pattern, he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me, and this is the bronze I got back.
And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.
And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.
Here, I'm going to put it out there, later on tonight, and I want you to pick it up and handle it.
You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me, and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper, in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
like it is in the movie.
Yeah, I know!
There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.
That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.
But there's a problem.
Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.
There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon, because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting, there's my master and there's my bronze.
There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things, which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin, you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one, it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah -- why didn't I remember this?
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?
So what do I do? I figure I have two options.
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it, which I have already done, to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze. Or: There are several people who own originals, and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them, hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture, or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box, and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear, get a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.
I'll give them one if they want it.
And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.
But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves, I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.
Thank you.

<title>Jan Chipchase: The anthropology of mobile phones</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nokia researcher Jan Chipchase's investigation into the ways we interact with technology has led him from the villages of Uganda to the insides of our pockets. He's made some unexpected discoveries along the way.</description>
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.
And I specialize in human behavioral research, and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways, and to design for that future.
And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years, and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.
But I've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there.
This is my office. It's out there.
It's not in the lab, and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.
We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.
About three billion people, by the end of this year, will have cellular connectivity.
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.
And I mention this because, if we want to design for that future, we need to figure out what those people are about.
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is and what our team's job is.
Our research often starts with a very simple question.
So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?
If you think of everything in your life that you own, when you walk out that door, what do you consider to take with you?
When you're looking around, what do you consider?
Of that stuff, what do you carry?
And of that stuff, what do you actually use?
So this is interesting to us, because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.
And to put it really bluntly, you know, people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?
So I've probably done about five years' research looking at what people carry.
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.
I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide, and we follow them around town with video cameras.
It's kind of like stalking with permission.
And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question, what do people carry?
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.
OK, that's fair enough.
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys, money and, if they own one, a mobile phone.
And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.
You'd probably kick me out, or something.
OK, it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.
But really, the question is, why? Right?
So why are these things so important in our lives?
And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones.
So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -- transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.
Money is useful for buying food, sustenance, among all its other uses.
And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff, but they're very good at this.
And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability to allow people to transcend space and time.
And what I mean by that is, you know, you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience, and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out, which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.
And they value that connectivity.
But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.
And you can do them with phone kiosks.
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.
You don't need to ask permission from anyone, you can just go ahead and do it, right?
However, for these things to help us survive, it depends on them being carried.
But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget.
We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.
I think, quite a nice feature.
So we forget, but we're also adaptable, and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.
And so we have these strategies to remember, and one of them was mentioned yesterday.
And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space, and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.
And you turn around, and you look back into the space, and some people talk aloud.
And pretty much everyone does it at some point.
OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life, and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels, but most people have what we call a center of gravity.
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity, but over time, they gravitate there.
It's where you expect to find stuff.
And in fact, when you're turning around, and you're looking inside the house, and you're looking for this stuff, this is where you look first, right?
OK, so when we did this research, we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way to never forget anything ever, ever again.
And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.
OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?
But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.
And from a design perspective, it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people.
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything, apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.
And apart from things like entertainment, you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf, or, at least, not yet.
Maybe sometime in the future, we will.
So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate.
So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures -- that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.
So, we've been conducting a lot of research.
And one of the things we were looking at is -- if you can't read and write, if you want to communicate over distances, you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with.
It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address, it could be a postal address.
Simple question: if you can't read and write, how do you manage your contact information?
And the fact is that millions of people do it.
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it, and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing.
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people, the stuff that they can't do themselves.
Let me give you another example of delegation.
This one's a little bit more sophisticated, and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.
Sente is a word in Uganda that means money.
It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?
And it works like this.
So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.
I'm sending money back, and it works like this.
So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone, and that's the phone kiosk operator.
And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.
So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone, I call up the local village operator.
And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.
So, they're topping up the value from Kampala, and it's now being topped up in the village.
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission, and passes the rest over to you in cash.
OK, there's two things I like about this.
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an ATM machine.
It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure.
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure, they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers, because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.
There's a second thing I like about this.
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal, and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication, I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?
And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.
But the difference between this and that is, there's no central authority trying to control this.
This is just street-up innovation.
So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of inspiration for us.
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.
They'll give you a new one.
They'll probably give you three new ones, right?
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks, and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China, and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together.
They reverse-engineer manuals.
This is a kind of hacker's manual, and it's written in Chinese and English.
They also write them in Hindi.
You can subscribe to these.
There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well.
But what I like about this is, it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface, a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.
And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff, and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.
It challenges the norms.
OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.
Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
And I know what you're asking -- did I test it?
I'm not going to answer that, OK.
But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process.
And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply, for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this -- apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?
This is a pair of underpants from -- -- from Tibet.
And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know, why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?
And I look at something like this and it makes me question, if we were to take all the functionality in things like this, and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network, how would we prioritize where to put stuff?
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks.
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda.
This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.
So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?
When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK, for those extra three billion people.
This is how it's shifting.
And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.
And this is from Delhi.
It's from a study we did into illiteracy, and it's a guy in a teashop.
You can see the chai being poured in the background.
And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker, on the lowest rungs in the society.
And he, somehow, has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong.
And it's not necessarily the same values, but some kind of values of Livestrong, to actually go out and purchase them, and actually display them.
For me, this kind of personifies this connected world, where everything is intertwined, and the dots are -- it's all about the dots joining together.
OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences," and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner, right?
When everyone's connected.
And there are four things.
So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas, the speed at which ideas go around.
And I know TED is about big ideas, but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.
If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet, that's the first thing.
The second thing is the immediacy of objects.
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller, as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking, identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid, in a way that we just totally cannot conceive, when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world's population.
The next thing is that, however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate, as long as it meets base needs -- the ability to transcend space and time, for example.
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.
In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.
That's my feeling.
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on, and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design.
And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation.
With another three billion people connected, they want to be part of the conversation.
And I think our relevance and TED's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.
And we need to learn how to listen.
So thank you very, very much.

<title>Mark Bittman: What's wrong with what we eat</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this fiery and funny talk, New York Times food writer Mark Bittman weighs in on what's wrong with the way we eat now , and why it's putting the entire planet at risk.</description>
I write about food. I write about cooking.
I take it quite seriously, but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two.
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?
But I still think that this -- -- may be this year's version of this.
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.
And why do I say it?
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined.
There was the bomb, and there's now.
And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it.
It's a holocaust of a different kind, and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.
Start with the notion that global warming is not only real, but dangerous.
Since every scientist in the world now believes this, and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to, we can take this is a given.
Then hear this, please.
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases.
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production -- more than transportation.
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane.
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.
There's more.
Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals.
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this: if you're a progressive, if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green, or you're looking for organic, you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom, but it's all in the way we use these things.
There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know.
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world.
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day -- our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.
Now global warming was unforeseen.
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal.
The current health crisis, however, is a little more the work of the evil empire.
We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be.
No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.
Not bad.
But back to animals and junk food.
What do they have in common?
One: we don't need either of them for health.
We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.
Two: both have been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand.
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.
Now, let's imagine a parallel.
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy, while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy, knowing all the while that the result would be pollution, war and rising costs.
Incredible, isn't it?
Yet they do that.
And they do this here. It's the same deal.
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail.
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness.
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs.
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others, and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food.
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.
And guess what?
Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness.
So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions.
But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches.
But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.
That's our number. 10 billion.
If you strung all of them -- chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon, they'd go there and back five times, there and back.
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good, and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long, but you get the idea.
That's just the United States.
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down, and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore," which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.
Seriously.
And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.
Between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating.
They both get it wrong, though.
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
And I'm going to go through that, at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.
A hundred years ago, guess what?
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby, and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.
And those moms bought and prepared food.
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.
Margarine didn't exist.
In fact, when margarine was invented, several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink, so we'd all know that it was a fake.
There was no snack food, and until the '20s, until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.
There were no restaurant chains.
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people, but none of them would think to open another one.
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.
And fancy food was entirely French.
As an aside, those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.
Back in those days, before even Julia, back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.
You just ate.
You didn't claim to be anything.
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.
Vitamins had not been invented.
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.
You ate food.
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient, because it was an ingredient.
The cornflake hadn't been invented.
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.
Goldfish swam.
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.
And again, everyone ate local.
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present, because it came all the way from Florida.
From the '30s on, road systems expanded, trucks took the place of railroads, fresh food began to travel more.
Oranges became common in New York.
The South and West became agricultural hubs, and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle, as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.
Thus arrived convenience.
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework.
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point.
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?
But this may have cut down on housework, but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding -- didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak?
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.
Rather than spending their lives eating grass, for which their stomachs were designed, they were forced to eat soy and corn.
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course, but that wasn't a problem for producers.
New drugs kept them healthy.
Well, they kept them alive.
Healthy was another story.
Thanks to farm subsidies, the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress, soy, corn and cattle became king.
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.
It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began, the thing we're only realizing just now.
Listen to this, between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.
Meat consumption increased five-fold.
Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups, because all of them could be bought at any store.
Not that they were any good, but they were there.
Most moms cooked like mine: a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing, canned soup, canned fruit salad.
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes, or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
It wasn't all bad.
By the '70s, forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients.
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food, we knew or we were vegetarians.
We weren't all hippies, either.
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.
Many people became fat-phobic.
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
Instead they were sold on yogurt, yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.
You think that that might be healthy food, but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list, it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.
Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma, if not actually killed -- the beginning of the heyday of value-added food, which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it.
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.
The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up, and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder, and then it's fried in corn oil.
All you do is nuke it. What could be better?
And zapped horribly, pathetically.
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets -- and we all have our favorites, actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home.
At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce, and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden.
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights, you've got your grazing nights, you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.
Leading the way -- what's leading the way?
Meat, junk food, cheese: the very stuff that will kill you.
So, now we clamor for organic food.
That's good.
And as evidence that things can actually change, you can now find organic food in supermarkets, and even in fast-food outlets.
But organic food isn't the answer either, at least not the way it's currently defined.
Let me pose you a question.
Can farm-raised salmon be organic, when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?
And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever, dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?
I don't know.
Packed in Styrofoam, of course, before landing somewhere in the United States, and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.
Now here is where we all meet.
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians, the vegans, the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.
Even though we've come to this from different points, we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food.
We need to start acting.
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said -- and, of course, she's completely right -- but it's also one of global survival.
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue, the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production.
How much livestock do you need to produce this?
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth, 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat.
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.
And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now, it's not going to be 40 years.
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.
The most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?
Isn't meat eating essential to health?
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?
Some of us might think that would be a good thing.
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players, the answer is no.
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth, and many will make you much healthier than ours does.
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition, we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat -- it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.
It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen, and what progressive people, forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating, along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.
During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything.
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure, but I do think that for the benefit of everyone, the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly.
Ann Cooper's right.
The USDA is not our ally here.
We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone -- and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.
And that happens to be quite easy.
Less meat, less junk, more plants.
It's a simple formula: eat food.
Eat real food.
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better.
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love, and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.
We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.
We can make food more important, not less, and save ourselves by doing so.
We have to choose that path.
Thank you.

<title>David Hanson: Robots that "show emotion"</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: David Hanson's robot faces look and act like yours: They recognize and respond to emotion, and make expressions of their own. Here, an "emotional" live demo of the Einstein robot offers a peek at a future where robots truly mimic humans.</description>
I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.
And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you.
So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you.
I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.
So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight.
The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen.
One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.
There he's starting to walk.
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
I built the head. They built the body.
So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy.
We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego.
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making.
It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.
We're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine.
And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.
In fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.
Okay. So I'm smiling.
Now I'm frowning.
And this is really heavily backlit.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, it's so sad.
Okay, so you smile, frowning.
So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right?
Those machines have no place for empathy.
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.
Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy.
So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future.
So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.
And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.
This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.
And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.
So, we're involving two things.
One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.
So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."
In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life.
So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.
We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.
As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.

<title>Scott Kim: The art of puzzles</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At the 2008 EG conference, famed puzzle designer Scott Kim takes us inside the puzzle-maker's frame of mind. Sampling his career's work, he introduces a few of the most popular types, and shares the fascinations that inspired some of his best.</description>
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.
And I'm here today to give you a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed, through what I'm doing now.
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.
I've been doing that for about 10 years.
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."
I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.
So, very first puzzle, sixth grade, my teacher said, "Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board."
I thought this was a great assignment.
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once.
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?
One hint: It's not "L."
It could be an "L," of course.
So, what else could it be?
Yeah, a lot of you got it.
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.
Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.
I created something new, I was very excited because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles, but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.
This was something really original. I got hooked.
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer.
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems, which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.
You know, they might have a solution.
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.
Who designed this?
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies.
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer; many puzzles have more than one.
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.
You can create one out of Legos.
You know, you can do anything you want.
Or competitive games like chess where, well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle, but the goal really is to beat another player.
I consider that puzzles are an art form.
They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.
It's a very small form, like a joke, a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression.
The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.
So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games, is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.
So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.
This is called a figure-ground illusion.
The artist M.C. Escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints.
Here we have "Day and Night."
Here is what I did with figure and ground.
So, here we have "figure" in black.
Here we have "figure" in white.
And it's all part of the same design.
The background to one is the other.
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."
But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.
It's all "figure."
A few other things. Here is my name.
And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."
These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.
Each letter here is one of these digits.
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.
Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.
It's the same this way.
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.
And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.
This appears in my puzzle calendar.
Okay, let's go back to the slides.
Thank you very much.
Now, those are fun to look at.
Now how would you do it interactively?
For a while I was an interface designer.
And so I think a lot about interaction.
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion, make the thing on the right.
Now, if you could pick up the black vase, it would look like the figure on top.
If you could pick up the white area, it would look like the figure on the bottom.
Well, you can't do that physically, but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.
And here it is, figure-ground.
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right.
And this follows the rules I just said: any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.
But that is also true of any white area.
So, here we got the white area in the middle, and you can pick it up.
I'll just go one step further.
So, here is -- here is a couple pieces. Move them together, and now this is an active piece.
You can really get inside somebody's perception and have them experience something.
It's like the old maxim of "you can tell somebody something and show them, but if they do it they really learn it."
Here is another thing you can do.
There is a game called Rush Hour.
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube.
So, here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place.
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.
It's made by the company Think Fun.
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.
Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.
Okay, so how would you solve this one?
Well, move the blue one out of the way.
Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.
You know? What do you do here?
The first move is going to be what?
You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.
Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.
I wanted to make a sequel.
I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.
I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece, a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.
In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.
Now I'm making it available to schools.
And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles, but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.
So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them.
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.
In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.
I got interested in gene sequencing.
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?"
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces, and then you look for overlaps, and you basically match them at the edges. And I said, "This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.
There is only one solution. It's not that hard.
But it takes some persistence.
And when you're done, it makes this design, which, if you squint, is the word "helix."
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content, rather than the other way around.
Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.
Which way will these fall?
One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.
And depending on which one weighs which amount, they'll fall different directions.
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black, the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations, and you get these peculiar pictures.
Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures?
Gets you thinking about color.
Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com, website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.
So, we're making smart games for social media.
I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.
This is what's going on in the games industry right now.
First of all, you know, for a long time computer games meant things like "Doom," where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast, aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.
Well, guess what? That's changing.
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games.
And the main players are over 35, and are female.
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.
And it's a game you play with other people.
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.
Now, within that there is some interesting things happening.
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.
Why? Well, we aging Boomers, Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food, we're exercising. What about our minds?
Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.
A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.
Everybody now considers themselves a creator, and not just a viewer.
And what does this add up to?
Here is what we see coming.
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.
They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.
And we decided to combine our skills.
Our first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.
This is your first time playing my game. Okay.
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images.
And we have 24 seconds each.
Where is that?
I'll play as fast as I can.
But if you can see it, shout out the answer.
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?
Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and -- I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.
That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.
Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.
Okay, so that's the lens.
Anybody?
Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?
That's the corner of the whole thing.
Yeah, I've played this image before, but even when I make up my own puzzles -- and you can put your own images in here.
And we have people all over the world doing that now.
There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com if you want to try it yourself. Thank you.

<title>Gever Tulley: Life lessons through tinkering</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Gever Tulley uses engaging photos and footage to demonstrate the valuable lessons kids learn at his Tinkering School. When given tools, materials and guidance, these young imaginations run wild and creative problem-solving takes over to build unique boats, bridges and even a roller coaster!</description>
This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School.
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects, and be trusted.
Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others.
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum, and there are no tests.
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.
When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff: wood and nails and rope and wheels, and lots of tools, real tools.
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.
And within that context, we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives.
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around.
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.
And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success, or gleeful calamity.
We start from doodles and sketches.
And sometimes we make real plans.
And sometimes we just start building.
Building is at the heart of the experience: hands on, deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand.
Robin and I, acting as collaborators, keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion.
Success is in the doing, and failures are celebrated and analyzed.
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear.
When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities, a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation.
From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before.
All materials are available for use.
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined.
And the things that they build amaze even themselves.
Video: Three, two, one, go!
Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.
Video: Yay!
GT: Thank you. It's been a great pleasure.

<title>Bruce McCall: What is retro-futurism?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Bruce McCall paints a retro-future that never happened -- full of flying cars, polo-playing tanks and the RMS Tyrannic, "The Biggest Thing in All the World." At Serious Play '08, he narrates a brisk and funny slideshow of his faux-nostalgic art.</description>
I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.
I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada, and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone, and I paint on paper using gouache, which hasn't changed in 600 years.
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York, and I titled it "Serious Nonsense."
So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead.
I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side, I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it -- it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.
And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors, and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor -- which you can't see there.
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.
This is a home-built rocket-propelled car. That's a 1953 Henry J -- I'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo.
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film.
You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town.
My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it.
And I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism," which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.
And they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong.
And the peak time for that was the 30s, because the Depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ...
and technology was going to carry us along.
This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days -- I had a huge collection of them from the '30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful.
Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties.
I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter, so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject.
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half.
This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.
That's from a whole catalog -- it's 18 pages or so -- ran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason, usually.
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based, obviously, on the Hindenburg.
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark, and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.
The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter, but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.
You needed to know that.
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream.
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car.
This is pitched into the future from 1946, looking at the day all American families have them.
"There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!"
Faux-nostalgia, which I'm sort of -- not, say, famous for, but I work an awful lot in it.
It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion -- so I think that’s a case for serious play.
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining, recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s, dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here, but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.
This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that.
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.
I think it adds a huge amount.
Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.
They had two machine guns and a cannon, and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.
And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas.
Happy little story, isn't it?
This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s, where you drove up to your front door, if you had the guts.
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there.
I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm.
And I love cigars -- there's a cigar billboard down there.
And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war.
This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940, when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.
It's a fond memory of times past.
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit, just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- "RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."
The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages, says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over, and it's so safe it carries no insurance.
It's obviously modeled on the Titanic.
But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements.
It's just a sick, silly joke.
Shamelessly cheap is something, I think -- this will wake you up.
It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi, and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that, and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."
People wrote in for reprints of that thing.
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.
I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m., and this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that -- who’s to say?
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it's a very somber place.
I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.
This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.
I couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying, "This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed, please apologize on our website."
Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may.
This is the word side of my brain.
I love the word "Eurotrash."
That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs.
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France.
If you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move.
Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France -- sign of our times, I guess.
This is the only fashion cover I've ever done.
It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing -- the title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood."
I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion -- I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane, and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying: "Put a strap on it" -- "No, don't put a strap on it" -- "Put a strap on it -- "Don't put a strap on it" -- because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and -- I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe.
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.
This is a big joke.
This is the audition for "King Kong."
People always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover, in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.
It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.
And then when it ran, a lovely lady, an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover, it was so sweet.
Her former name was Fay Wray, and so that was -- I didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting."
Finally, this was a three-page cover, never done before, and I don't think it will ever be done again -- successive pages in the front of the magazine.
It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.
You can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough, you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.
Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre.
I would just like to add a crass commercial -- I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches," a compendium of all the serious play that ever was, and it’s going to be available in fine bookstores, crummy bookstores, tables on the street in October.
So thank you very much.

<title>Marco Tempest: Augmented reality, techno-magic</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Using sleight-of-hand techniques and charming storytelling, illusionist Marco Tempest brings a jaunty stick figure to life onstage at TEDGlobal.</description>
So magic is a very introverted field.
While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.
That's true even amongst peers.
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research?
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.
And about three years ago, I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster.
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.
It's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system, or a digital storytelling tool.
Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.
And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.
Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.
Wake up.
Hey.
Come on.
Please.
Come on.
Ah, sorry about that.
Forgot this.
Give it another try.
Okay.
He figured out the system.
Uh oh.
All right. Let's try this.
Come on.
Hey.
You heard her, go ahead.
Bye-bye.

<title>Kary Mullis: A next-gen cure for killer infections</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Drug-resistant bacteria kills, even in top hospitals. But now tough infections like staph and anthrax may be in for a surprise. Nobel-winning chemist Kary Mullis, who watched a friend die when powerful antibiotics failed, unveils a radical new cure that shows extraordinary promise.</description>
So it was about four years ago, five years ago, I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was, with a bag similar to this.
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well, but your body knows it extremely well.
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.
Actually our body doesn't hate these.
Our body loves these. It eats them.
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell, it means "that's food."
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.
But I said we can't get rid of it, because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity.
And I said, why don't you use that?
What if I could stick this molecule, slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?
I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there, where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana.
It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.
So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street.
And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
Our antibiotics are running out.
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.
So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here. But if we are -- we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.
So I started working with this thing, with a bunch of collaborators.
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones, bacteria that we don't like.
And I feel now like George Bush.
It's like "mission accomplished."
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there, sort of symbolizing this right now.
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body, and will alert your immune system to go after it.
Here's what happened. See that line on the very top with the little dots?
That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas, at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular, and direct your immune system to it.
You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line -- that's a 100 percent survival rate.
And they actually lived another 14 days, or 28 when we finally killed them, and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.
Why did they not die?
And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.
So we did it. Okay?
Mission accomplished!

<title>Hans Rosling: Global population growth, box by box</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The world's population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth. This is the paradoxical answer that Hans Rosling unveils at TED@Cannes using colorful new data display technology .</description>
I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960.
I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks.
Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box.
This box contains one billion people.
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people.
In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people.
And they lived away then.
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world.
In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families.
And their aspiration was to buy a car.
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this.
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.
But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day.
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes.
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up.
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World."
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.
And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population.
Just look how many.
The world population has doubled since I went to school.
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here.
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly.
So this is where they are today.
And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them.
They are now buying cars.
And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world.
So there they are.
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago.
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have.
And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.
But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap.
But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever.
But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.
This is the new world we have today in 2010.
And what will happen in the future?
Well, I'm going to project into 2050.
I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did.
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent.
[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.
They will start flying.
And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically.
And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here.
And they will start to buy electric cars.
This is what we will find there.
So what about the poorest two billion?
What about the poorest two billion here?
Will they move on?
Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end.
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion.
There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening.
Because we already have this [growth] in process.
But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050.
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth.
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology.
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles.
Every bubble is a country. The size is population.
The colors show the continent.
The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia.
That's India and this is China. Size is population.
Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families.
The year is 1960.
And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival.
What has happened? I start the world. Here we go.
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?
They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families].
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.
The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion.
Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here?
They are still up here.
And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation.
And the population will double in one generation.
So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent.
That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world.
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.
Child survival is the new green.
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth.
And will it happen?
Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist.
I'm a very serious "possibilist."
It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world.
It can be done.
We can have a much more just world.
With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this.
And look at the position of the old West.
Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life.
This will not happen [again].
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less.
But it's a very important role.
Do it well and get used to it.
Thank you very much.

<title>Joe Sabia: The technology of storytelling</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: iPad storyteller Joe Sabia introduces us to Lothar Meggendorfer, who created a bold technology for storytelling: the pop-up book. Sabia shows how new technology has always helped us tell our own stories, from the walls of caves to his own onstage iPad.</description>
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.
I would love to share with you a story.
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.
Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.
It was venerable.
It was ubiquitous.
But it was a little bit boring.
Because in its 400 years of existence, storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device.
But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever.
His name was Lothar, Lothar Meggendorfer.
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down, and he said, "Genug ist genug!"
He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors.
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold.
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else? -- the world's first true inventor of the children's pop-up book.
For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced.
They were happy because the story survived, and that the world would keep on spinning.
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last.
Whether storytellers realized it or not, they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville, radio news to radio theater, film to film in motion to film in sound, color, 3D, on VHS and on DVD.
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.
Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.
For example, one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine.
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D.
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.
And after all this, everyone paused; they took a step back.
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling, they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.
And this was a cause for celebration.
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure, consistent novelty.
And they remembered a man, one amazing German, every time a new storytelling device popped up next.
And for that, the audience -- the lovely, beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after.

<title>Jeff Smith: Lessons in business ... from prison</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Jeff Smith spent a year in prison. But what he discovered inside wasn’t what he expected -- he saw in his fellow inmates boundless ingenuity and business savvy. He asks: Why don't we tap this entrepreneurial potential to help ex-prisoners contribute to society once they're back outside? </description>
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future.
He had a vision. When he got out, he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight, and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.
He'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.
It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton: promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product launches, territorial expansion.
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.
It's a lot harder than you might think.
Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you don't make a lot of money.
I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job, unloading trucks at a food warehouse, for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.
So how do you survive?
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
There's legal hustles.
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be.
You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.
You want a dirty magazine?
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity.
Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training businesses.
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even.
And then, when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background.
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons, because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.
Thank you.

<title>Alex Laskey: How behavioral science can lower your energy bill</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What's a proven way to lower your energy costs? Would you believe: learning what your neighbor pays. Alex Laskey shows how a quirk of human behavior can make us all better, wiser energy users, with lower bills to prove it.</description>
How many of you have checked your email today?
Come on, raise your hands.
How many of you are checking it right now?
And how about finances? Anybody check that today?
Credit card, investment account?
How about this week?
Now, how about your household energy use?
Anybody check that today?
This week? Last week?
A few energy geeks spread out across the room.
It's good to see you guys.
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet, and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change.
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet.
We met her on our first family vacation.
Harriet's paying attention to her energy use, and she is decidedly not an energy geek.
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.
This is coal, the most common source of electricity on the planet, and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year.
But unfortunately, between here and here, most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat.
In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year, you'd need this much coal.
The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use, we waste nine.
That means there's good news, because for every unit of energy we save, we save the other nine.
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using, and start wasting less of it?
The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago, and only 90 miles from here, in San Marcos, California.
Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood, asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans.
One quarter of the homes received a message that said, did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?
Turn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.
Another group got an environmental message.
And still a third group got a message about being good citizens, preventing blackouts.
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.
In fact, none of these messages worked.
They had zero impact on energy consumption.
It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.
But there was a fourth message, and this message simply said, "When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.
Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans."
And wouldn't you know it, they did.
The people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing.
So what does this tell us?
Well, if something is inconvenient, even if we believe in it, moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us -- but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.
And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.
In fact, it already is.
Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I started a company called Opower.
We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy.
We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.
Just like those effective door hangers, we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors, and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save.
We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application, web, and now even a controllable thermostat, and for the last five years we've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world.
And it's working.
Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills, and we're just getting started.
This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities in six countries, we're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings.
Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours, but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year.
Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.
And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal, we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity.
And we're not burning anything.
We're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior.
But we're just one company, and this is just scratching the surface.
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted, and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs. They may.
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms, and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.
That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change.
That's 40 billion -- with a B -- every year in the U.S. alone.
That's half our coal usage right there.
Now thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these, and this is both fantastic and essential.
But the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.
It's in this room. It's you, and it's me.
And we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science.
We can do it today, we know it works, and it will save us money right away.
So what are we waiting for?
Well, in most places, utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy.
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.
But this story is much more than about household energy use.
Take a look at the Prius.
It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science.
The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they're saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers.
Which brings us back to Harriet.
We met her on our first family vacation.
She came over to meet my young daughter, and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name is also Harriet.
She asked me what I did for a living, and I told her, I work with utilities to help people save energy.
It was then that her eyes lit up.
She looked at me, and she said, "You're exactly the person I need to talk to.
You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility.
It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."
"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about, talk about, and even argue about, is what we should be doing to save energy.
We did everything that letter told us to do, and still I know there must be more.
Now I'm here with a genuine expert.
Tell me. What should I do to save energy?"
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.
My goal is to make sure we are all asking it.
Thank you.

<title>Ami Klin: A new way to diagnose autism</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected, but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict. At TEDxPeachtree, Ami Klin describes a new early detection method that uses eye-tracking technologies to gauge babies' social engagement skills and reliably measure their risk of developing autism.</description>
I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement, to resonate other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, motivations, in the act of being with them.
As a scientist, I always wanted to measure that resonance, that sense of the other that happens so quickly, in the blink of an eye.
We intuit other people's feelings.
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen.
We're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity.
We do that all the time. We just can't shake it off.
It's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves, to understand the world around them, is shaped by that stance.
We are social to the core.
So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.
Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals. This is a long time ago.
And for them, autism was devastating.
They had profound intellectual disabilities.
They didn't talk. But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people.
In fact, at the time, if you walked into a school for individuals with autism, you'd hear a lot of noise, plenty of commotion, actions, people doing things, but they're always doing things by themselves.
So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling, or they may be isolated in the corner, or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements, in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere.
Extremely, extremely isolated.
Well, now we know that autism is this disruption, the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you.
These are survival skills.
These are survival skills that we inherited over many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
You see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility.
Without the caregiver, they wouldn't survive, so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival.
They orient to the caregiver.
From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment.
They prefer to look at people rather than at things, and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences, so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away.
Well, they orient to the caregiver.
The caregiver seeks the baby.
And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind, the social mind, the social brain, depends on.
We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life.
It doesn't. It begins with the beginning of life.
As babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well, there is something in between the ears that is very important -- it's invisible, you can't see -- but is really critical, and that thing is called attention.
And they learn soon enough, even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want.
They also learn to follow other people's gaze, because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about.
And soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things, because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something, they're not just getting a directional cue, they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing, the attitude, and soon enough they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction.
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others.
Well, this is a little 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism.
And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me.
Imagine if I did that to you, and I came two inches from your face.
You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?
You would recoil. You would call the police.
You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get a reaction.
We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly.
This is our body wisdom. It's not something that is mediated by our language. Our body just knows that, and we've known that for a long time.
And this is not something that happens to humans only.
It happens to some of our phylatic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long.
So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without them they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, act socially.
Now, she is oblivious to me, and I am so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you.
Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;M.
So I could not attract her attention, but something, a thing, did.
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people.
Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like.
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences.
Now, what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further.
So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic, the brain determines who we are going to be.
But in fact the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind and this is what's happening with her brain.
Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders, and it's a brain disorder.
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born.
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled, but there are those that are gifted.
There are those individuals who don't talk at all.
There are those individuals who talk too much.
There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school, you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them, to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly, but often in an awkward fashion, without that immediate resonance.
Well, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time.
When I started in this field, we thought that there were four individuals with autism per 10,000, a very rare condition.
Well, now we know it's more like one in 100.
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us.
The societal cost of this condition is huge.
In the U.S. alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars, and you know what? Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled, individuals who need wrap-around services, services that are very, very intensive, and those services can cost in excess of 60 to 80,000 dollars a year.
Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment, because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you.
Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point, and intervene and treat, I can tell you, and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years, this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition.
Also, we have a window of opportunity, because the brain is malleable for just so long, and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life.
It's not that that window closes. It doesn't.
But it diminishes considerably.
And yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years, and in disadvantaged populations, the populations that don't have access to clinical services, rural populations, minorities, the age of diagnosis is later still, which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe.
So I feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative.
The science is there, but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community, and we just can't afford that missed opportunity, because children with autism become adults with autism, and we feel that those things that we can do for these children, for those families, early on, will have lifetime consequences, for the child, for the family, and for the community at large.
So this is our view of autism.
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact, we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism, and genetic anomalies, much more than just genes.
And we actually have a bit of a question here, because if there are so many different causes of autism, how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome? Because people like myself, when we walk into a playroom, we recognize a child as having autism.
So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?
And the answer is, what lies in between, which is development.
And in fact, we are very interested in those first two years of life, because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism.
Autism creates itself.
Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life, we might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others.
So how do we do that?
How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being?
I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-older, that the thing that came to mind was, "How do you come into her world?
Is she thinking about me? Is she thinking about others?"
Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies. We had to basically step inside a body.
We had to see the world through her eyes.
And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking.
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with.
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.
What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to create these very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment, what is important, and what is not.
Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention.
You're watching a video.
Those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds, and we freeze one frame, and this is what the typical children are doing.
In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism.
So on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this, the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl.
What are the children with autism doing?
They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting.
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.
It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed, and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers.
Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts.
You know, when you take a child to the pediatrician, and so you have physical height, and weight.
Well we decided that we're going to create growth charts of social engagement, and we sought children from the time that they are born, and what you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five, six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months, and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart.
They start over here, they love people's eyes, and it remains quite stable.
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
Now, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic.
It's something very different.
It starts way up here, but then it's a free fall.
It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people, but it has no traction.
It's almost as if that stimulus, you, you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives.
Now, we thought that those data were so powerful in a way, that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life, because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older, you'd be surprised by how social those babies are.
And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily.
And using these kinds of measures, and many others, what we found out is that our science could, in fact, identify this condition early on.
We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life.
If we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved, and developmentally very early emerging, things that are online from the first weeks of life, we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months, and that's what we are doing now.
Now, we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children, but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community.
Now we want those devices, of course, to be deployed by those who are in the trenches, our colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child, and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice, because they have to see so many children.
And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child, but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment.
We need to be able to work with the families, to support the families, to manage those first years with them. We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment, because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives.
Now, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years, I can tell you, having been in this field for so long, one feels really rejuvenated.
There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities, preventing, in fact, those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field.
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition.
No longer. We can do a great deal of things.
And the idea is not to cure autism.
That's not the idea.
What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times, the profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language, the profound, profound isolation.
We feel that individuals with autism, in fact, have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity, and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength: predictable situations, situations that can be defined.
Because after all, they learn about the world almost like about it, rather than learning how to function in it.
But this is a strength, if you're working, for example, in technology.
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities.
We want them to be free of that.
We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise.
Well thank you for listening to me.

<title>Bruce Feiler: Agile programming -- for your family</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Bruce Feiler has a radical idea: To deal with the stress of modern family life, go agile. Inspired by agile software programming, Feiler introduces family practices which encourage flexibility, bottom-up idea flow, constant feedback and accountability. One surprising feature: Kids pick their own punishments.</description>
So here's the good news about families.
The last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family.
We have blended families, adopted families, we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house.
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.
Eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.
Now, here's the bad news.
Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life.
Every parent I know, myself included, feels like we're constantly playing defense.
Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath, they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.
And here's the worst news of all.
Our children sense we're out of control.
Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute asked 1,000 children, "If you were granted one wish about your parents, what would it be?"
The parents predicted the kids would say, spending more time with them.
They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?
That their parents be less tired and less stressed.
So how can we change this dynamic?
Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress, draw our family closer, and generally prepare our children to enter the world?
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question, traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars, experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?
I want to tell you about one family that I met, and why I think they offer clues.
At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho, where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.
The Starrs are a regular American family with their share of regular American family problems.
David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care of their four children, ages 10 to 15.
One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.
One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.
Instead of turning to friends or relatives, they looked to David's workplace.
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley.
In agile, workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time.
So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations, the team in effect manages itself.
You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.
You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.
David said when they brought this system into their home, the family meetings in particular increased communication, decreased stress, and made everybody happier to be part of the family team.
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters, it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes.
So what is Agile, and why can it help with something that seems so different, like families?
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England.
He was very frustrated with how software got designed.
Companies followed the waterfall method, right, in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below, and no one had ever consulted the programmers.
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.
They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done.
Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time.
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review before stumbling upon an article in 1986 called "The New New Product Development Game."
It said that the pace of business was quickening -- and by the way, this was in 1986 -- and the most successful companies were flexible.
It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article, and said, "That's it."
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use large, massive projects that take two years.
They do things in small chunks.
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network," you say, "You go off and come up with one element, then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."
You succeed or fail quickly.
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries, and it's sweeping into management suites.
Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families.
You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving, where you had one group of people working on the food, one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.
So let's take one problem that families face, crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.
A key plank is accountability, so teams use information radiators, these large boards in which everybody is accountable.
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home, created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores.
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs, poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair, and she sat there, kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs, checked the list, made themselves breakfast, checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher, rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had, checked the list once more, gathered their belongings, and made their way to the bus.
It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.
And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house, our kids needed way too much monitoring, Eleanor looked at me.
"That's what I thought," she said.
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.' But I was wrong."
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."
And he made a checkmark.
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.
With kids, it's heaven."
The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house, it cut parental screaming in half.
But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.
So following the agile model, we ask three questions: What worked well in our family this week, what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?
Everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on.
And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.
What worked well this week?
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.
What didn't work well? Our math sheets, or greeting visitors at the door.
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out, I mean at least not that are revealing.
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.
But the most surprising part was when we turned to, what are we going to work on in the week ahead?
You know, the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves, and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.
Our kids love this process.
So they would come up with all these ideas.
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.
Now look, naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week, but the truth is it didn't really bother us.
It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now -- We're still holding these meetings.
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.
So what did we learn?
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001 when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.
I'm proposing three planks.
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.
We can't. What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.
It's like they say in the Internet world: if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago, you're doing the wrong thing.
Parents can learn a lot from that.
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus or other family experts.
The truth is, their ideas are stale, whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively.
Let's just take a few examples.
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.
Everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids.
But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said, "No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?
We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.
We'll make Sunday meals more important."
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal.
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."
You can take that 10 minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit.
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.
An environmental psychologist told me, "If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface, you'll be more rigid.
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."
She told me, "When you're discipling your children, sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.
The conversation will go better."
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because I was sitting above in the power position.
So move where you sit. That's adaptability.
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.
We've got to hook them up with parents.
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.
Plank number two: Empower your children.
Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.
There's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family.
But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting, and we had voted to work on overreacting.
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.
So we kind of liked that.
But then her sister started working the system.
She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"
I loved that. Spend the time however you want.
Now give us a punishment. Okay.
If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.
There's plenty of parental authority going on.
But we're giving them practice becoming independent, which of course is our ultimate goal.
Just as I was leaving to come here tonight, one of my daughters started screaming.
The other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"
and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.
To me that is a certified agile miracle.
And by the way, research backs this up too.
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules, evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives.
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms, and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker, and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance.
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"
He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary or a $6 million inheritance."
So the bottom line is, empower your children.
Plank number three: Tell your story.
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great," told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common: they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.
So agile is great for stimulating progress, but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.
So how do you do that?
Collins coached us on doing something that businesses do, which is define your mission and identify your core values.
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.
We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.
We had a pajama party.
I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.
My wife bought a flip chart.
And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?
What values do we most uphold?
And we ended up with 10 statements.
We are travelers, not tourists.
We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.
Again, research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right, worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.
This family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right.
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?
And we didn't really know what to do, so we called her into my office.
The family mission statement was on the wall, and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"
And she kind of looked down the list, and she said, "Bring people together?"
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.
Another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from.
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple "what do you know" test.
Do you know where your grandparents were born?
Do you know where your parents went to high school?
Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness.
As the author of the study told me, children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence.
So my final plank is, tell your story.
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones.
If you give children this happy narrative, you give them the tools to make themselves happier.
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina" and its famous opening sentence, "All happy families are alike.
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.
Of course all happy families aren't alike."
But as I began working on this project, I began changing my mind.
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time, to identify the building blocks that successful families have.
I've mentioned just three here today: Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.
Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?
The answer, I believe, is yes.
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old, his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick, which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned: Happiness is not something we find, it's something we make.
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion.
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.
It's a matter of choice.
You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.
You just need to take small steps, accumulate small wins, keep reaching for that green stick.
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.
What's the secret to a happy family? Try.

<title>John Gerzema: The post-crisis consumer</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: John Gerzema says there's an upside to the recent financial crisis -- the opportunity for positive change. In this talk, he identifies four major cultural shifts driving new consumer behavior and shows how businesses are evolving to connect with thoughtful spending.</description>
Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years.
We've questioned the future of capitalism.
We've questioned the financial industry.
We've looked at our government oversight.
We've questioned where we're going.
And yet, at the same time, this very well may be a seminal moment in American history, an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America.
I'm calling this The Great Unwind.
And the idea is a simple, simple idea, which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action.
Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses, to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage, in daily life, to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward.
So, to understand this -- and I'm going to stress this -- it's not about the consumer being in retreat.
The consumer is empowered.
In order to understand this, we're going to step back and look a little bit at what's happened over the course of the last year and a half.
So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy. Okay?
Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.
Commodity prices are like this.
If you're a mom trying to manage a budget, and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer, and it's somewhere between 50 and 70, do you plan vacations? How do you buy?
What is your strategy in your household?
Will the bailout work? We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, healthcare, all these issues facing us.
You put them all together, you mix them up in a bouillabaisse, and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time-bomb.
In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis, because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives, actually contributed a large part to the problem.
This is something I call the 50-20 paradox.
It took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent. 50 years.
Do you know what this was right here?
This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high?
There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets. Right?
So, what happened though, over the course of the last 20 years -- we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate.
Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome.
All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today.
The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 percent to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years.
So consumers got overleveraged.
And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.
This is an absolutely staggering chart.
It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education, future children in our households.
So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout, what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills, first of all, 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.
But if you stack it up, you just see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out.
So this is the first 315 billion.
But I read this fact the other day, that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years, so if you think about that, the context, the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here, and trillion there, we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.
However, consumers have moved.
They are taking responsibility.
What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate.
In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis.
We are working our way back up to that 10 percent.
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years, almost a 3.7 percent decline.
Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they're using credit cards.
So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have.
And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest.
But that's not really the whole story.
Because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.
And you've got to admit, over the course of the last year and a half, consumers have been doing some pretty weird things.
It's been pretty staggering, what we've lived through.
If you take into account 80 percent of all Americans were born after World War II, this is essentially our Depression.
And so, as a result, some crazy things have happened.
I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks. Okay?
Dentists report molars, you know, people grinding their teeth, coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress.
And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.
Guns, gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January.
Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell institute.
And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003.
Does anybody know why?
No one is at the beach. So there is a bright side to everything.
But seriously, what we see happening, and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat, is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out.
And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right?
If you think about the last three decades, the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s, to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade, but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate.
By restricting their demand, consumers can actually align their values with their spending, and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more, but be about better.
We're going to explain that right now.
Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator, proprietary tool of VML and Young &amp; Rubicam, we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace.
We found a couple of really interesting things.
We're going to go through four value-shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors, that offer new management principles.
The first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life.
This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity, because the less excess that you have around you, the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.
Déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.
The management principle is dollars and cents.
So let's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value.
First things is we see something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
But seriously, we also have this phenomenon on Madison Avenue and in other places, where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary, sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases.
We see high-end haggling in fashion today.
High-end haggling for luxury and real estate.
We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice.
This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar.
Blue-collar yacht club, where you can join the yacht club, but you've got to work in the boat yard, as sort of condition of membership.
We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low key. Right?
Agritourism, going to vineyards and going to farms.
And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents.
What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting.
A couple things that are kind of cool.
One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer.
They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month, less at the end of the month. So what they did is they started to change their packaging.
Larger packs at the beginning of the month, smaller packaging at the end of the month.
Really interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants.
They've just instituted dynamic pricing.
So it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups, to the weather, to the team records, in setting prices for the consumer.
Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga.
Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed-cost.
Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living.
So micropayments have become huge.
And lastly, some people are using Hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill.
So, really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand.
The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play.
We see that play itself out with empathy and respect.
The consumer is demanding it.
And, as a result, businesses must provide not only value, but values.
Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company, looking for their conduct in the marketplace.
So, what we see with empathy and respect, lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession.
And I'll give you a few examples.
One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods, and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system.
Also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing, which has been unemployment, is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country.
We also see the phenomenon -- some of you may have "boomerang kids" -- these are "boomerang alumni," where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining.
We also talked about character and professionalism.
We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City, you know, in January, and suddenly Sully has become a key name on Babycenter.
So, from a value and values standpoint, what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.
They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with I.T. training, using their existing infrastructure to do something good.
Also a really interesting company is Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees, to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses.
But they also talk about the fact that their executives, all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see.
Complete transparency.
Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living.
We're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon, not a sprint.
They are digging in. And they're looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make.
Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before, 9.4 years on average, in March. A record.
We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America.
Did you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card?
The highest percentage ever in our nation's history.
So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge.
Continuing education is up.
Everything is focused on betterment, and training, and development and moving forward.
We also see a big DIY movement.
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners.
That includes cottages and the like. But 30 percent.
So, people are getting their hands dirty. They are rolling up their sleeves.
They want these skills.
We see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work, but the principle is there that it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself.
And then we look at the High Line in New York City, an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good, which is a brand new park in New York City.
So, what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers, be a brand that lasts, offer transparency, promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale.
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.
Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make.
Another great example is Fidelity.
Rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases, this is about 529 rewards for your student education.
Or the interesting company SunRun.
I love this company. They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility, where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace.
So, it's a consumer driven co-op.
So, the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold.
It's incredibly important right now.
Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.
It's now about connecting to your communities, connecting to your social networks.
In my book I talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising.
So, in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off.
This is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace.
Let's look at a couple of quick examples.
The artisanal movement is huge.
Everything about locally derived products and services, supporting your local neighborhoods, whether it's cheeses, wines and other products.
Also this rise of local currencies.
Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment, you're doing business with people you trust, in your local markets.
So, this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon.
And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating.
They actually started, in certain communities in the United States, start to publish people's electricity usage.
And what they found out is when that was available for public record, the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.
Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling, which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled.
And then there is this other really interesting movement that's happened in California, which is about carrot mobs.
The traditional thing would be to boycott right?
Have a stick? Well why not have a carrot?
So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good.
And then we look at what companies can do.
This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer.
You have to realize that you can't fight and control this.
You actually need to organize it.
You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning.
And there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see.
First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating healthcare.
So what credentials does Zagat's have?
Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. Right?
So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic.
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. Right?
It's a moving truck through L.A., and the only way you can find it is through Twitter.
Or you look at Johnson &amp; Johnson's Momversations.
A phenomenal blog that's been built up.
Where J&amp;J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers, allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect.
And it's also become a very, very valuable sort of advertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.
This plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs from Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter, creating an open environment, allowing their employees to be part of the process, rather than hidden behind walls.
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, all because the consumer is demanding it.
So, when we look at this and we step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real.
It's been tremendously powerful for consumers.
But, at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity.
And the Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin.
Crisis equals opportunity.
What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession.
So, we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better.
It will drive innovation.
It will make longer-lasting products. It will create better, more intuitive customer service.
It will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share.
So, when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data, we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.
Thank you very much.

<title>Scott McCloud: The visual magic of comics</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this unmissable look at the magic of comics, Scott McCloud bends the presentation format into a cartoon-like experience, where colorful diversions whiz through childhood fascinations and imagined futures that our eyes can hear and touch.</description>
Of the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most, and it's the one that I can least take for granted.
I think this is partially due to my father, who was blind.
It was a fact that he didn't make much of a fuss about, usually.
One time in Nova Scotia, when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun -- yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song, which may or may not refer to James Taylor, Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.
They handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes.
But Dad got really scared: he didn't want us doing that.
He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged.
I thought this was a little strange at the time.
What I didn't know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight.
When he and his sister Martha were just very little, their mom took them out to see a total eclipse -- or actually, a solar eclipse -- and not long after that, both of them started losing their eyesight.
Decades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection.
As near as we can tell, it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse, but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault.
So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946, married my mom, and bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts, where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775, although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord.
He got a job working for Raytheon, designing guidance systems, which was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days -- so the equivalent of Silicone Valley in the '70s.
Dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy; he just really felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in World War II on account of his handicap, although they did let him get through the several-hour-long army physical exam before they got to the very last test, which was for vision.
So, Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor.
But to us he was just Dad, and our home life was pretty normal.
As a kid, I watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics.
I played a lot of chess.
But at the age of 14, a friend of mine got me interested in comic books, and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living.
So, here's my dad: he's a scientist, he's an engineer and he's a military contractor.
So, he has four kids, right?
One grows up to become a computer scientist, one grows up to join the Navy, one grows up to become an engineer, and then there's me: the comic book artist.
Which, incidentally, makes me the opposite of Dean Kamen, because I'm a comic book artist, son of an inventor, and he's an inventor, son of a comic book artist.
Right, it's true.
The funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me.
He had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist, even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever: everything he saw was just a blur.
Now, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith," which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people.
Now, faith in things which cannot be seen, which cannot be proved, is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much.
I tend to like science, where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know.
But there's a middle ground, too.
A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage, and his steam-driven computers that were never built.
Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind, except for Ada Lovelace, and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream.
Vannevar Bush with his Memex -- this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips -- he had this vision.
And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook.
And, yeah, we can look back in retrospect and say, yeah, ha-ha, you know -- it's all microfilm. But that's -- that's not the point. He understood the shape of the future.
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction.
Same thing: he understood the shape of the future, even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later.
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
Or even the people who actually pulled it off, the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston, who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network, and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts, just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips singing "Midnight Train to Georgia," while -- -- in my dad's big easy chair, you know?
So, three types of vision, right?
Vision based on what one cannot see: the vision of that unseen and unknowable.
The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.
And this third kind of vision, of something which can be, which may be, based on knowledge, but is as yet unproven.
Now, we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science, but I think it's also true in the arts, it's true in politics, it's even true in personal endeavors.
What it comes down to, really, is four basic principles: learn from everyone, follow no one, watch for patterns, and work like hell.
I think these are the four principles that go into this.
And it's that third one, especially, where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves.
What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world, is, I think, only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor.
In comics, I know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works.
Then there's another, more classical, attitude which embraces beauty and craft.
Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content.
And then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience -- and honesty, and rawness.
These are four very different ways of looking at the world. I even gave them names.
The classicist, the animist, and formalist and iconoclast.
Interestingly, it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought.
And they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right; tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.
And if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth.
And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art, which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all, or for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme of "Inspired by Nature" -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him, but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die, but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says, "Because it's my nature" -- in that sense, yes.
So -- so this was my nature. The thing was, I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was, I saw it as just this road to discovery.
Actually, it was just me embracing my nature, which means that I didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all.
So what does a "scientific mind" do in the arts?
Well, I started making comics, but I also started trying to understand them, almost immediately.
And one of the most important things about comics, I discovered, was that comics are a visual medium, but they try to embrace all of the senses within it.
So, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words, and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision.
So you have things like resemblance, where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions: abstracted from resemblance, but still retaining the complete meaning, or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan.
Put all these three together, and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace.
And if you move to the right you also get language, because that's abstracting even further from resemblance, but still maintaining meaning.
Vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage, as well.
Also, to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals.
And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics.
Comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels, and then gives you something to imagine between the panels.
Also, another sense which comics' vision represents, and that's time.
Sequence is a very important aspect of comics.
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.
And this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics, but I was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms, and I found some in history.
And you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea.
What's happening is, the art form is colliding with the given technology, whether it's paint on stone, like the Tomb of the Scribe in ancient Egypt, or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column, or a 200-foot-long embroidery, or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 88 accordion-folded pages.
What's interesting is, once you hit print -- and this is from 1450, by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves: rectilinear panel arrangements, simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence.
And within 100 years, you already start to see word balloons and captions, and it's really just a hop, skip and a jump from here to here.
So I wrote a book about this in '93, but as I was finishing the book, I had to do a little bit of typesetting, and I was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it, so I bought a computer.
And it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about Moore's Law, about Moore's Law back in the '70s, and I knew what was coming.
And so, I kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre-print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.
So, one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound, motion and interactivity of the CD-ROMs that were being made in those days.
This was even before the Web.
And one of the first things they did was, they tried to take the comics page as-is and transplant it to monitors, which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology.
And so, what they would do is, they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages, and they would introduce all this sound and motion.
The problem was, that if you go with this idea -- this basic idea that space equals time in comics -- what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion, which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time, then they break with that continuity of presentation.
Interactivity was another thing.
There were hypertext comics.
But the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here, not here or connected to here; it's profoundly non-spatial.
The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny, the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to "Plan 9" to nine lives: it's all the same.
And -- but in comics, in comics, every aspect of the work, every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.
So the question was: was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us?
And I found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that I was showing you.
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line, whether it's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right, or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 88 accordion-folded pages.
The same thing is happening, and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise, but there were compromises when print hit.
Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments, so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again.
And I thought, O.K., well, if that's true, is there any way, when we go beyond today's print, to somehow bring that back?
Now, the monitor is just as limited as the page, technically, right?
It's a different shape, but other than that it's the same basic limitation.
But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page, but not if you look at the monitor as a window.
And that's what I proposed: that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas: along the X axis and the Y axis and staircases.
We could do circular narratives that were literally circular.
We could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn.
Parallel narratives could be literally parallel.
X, Y and also Z.
So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '90s, and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy, but a lot of people then went on and actually did it.
I'm going to show you a couple now.
This was an early collage comic by a fellow named Jason Lex.
And notice what's going on here.
What I'm searching for is a durable mutation -- that's what all of us are searching for.
As media head into this new era, we are looking for mutations that are durable, that have some sort of staying power.
Now, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium, and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end.
That's that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now.
But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time, that's just where the technology is right now.
As the technology evolves, as you get full immersive displays and whatnot, this sort of thing will only grow.
It will adapt. It will adapt to its environment: it's a durable mutation.
Here's another one I'll show you. This is by Drew Weing; this is called, "Pup Contemplates the Heat Death of the Universe."
See what's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about.
We'll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea.
I just want to get to the last panel.
There we go.
Just one more.
Talk about your infinite canvas.
It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain.
Why is this important?
I think this is important because media, all media, provide us a window back into our world.
Now, it could be that motion pictures -- and eventually, virtual reality, or something equivalent to it -- some sort of immersive display, is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in.
That's why most people turn to storytelling, is to escape.
But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in.
And when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique.
Because what you're looking at is, you're looking at comics cubed: you're looking at comics that are more comics-like than they've ever been before.
When that happens, you provide people with multiple ways of re-entering the world through different windows, and when you do that, it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape.
And that's why I think this is important.
One of many reasons, but I've got to go now.
Thank you for having me.

<title>Alan Siegel: Let's simplify legal jargon!</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Tax forms, credit agreements, healthcare legislation: They're crammed with gobbledygook, says Alan Siegel, and incomprehensibly long. He calls for a simple, sensible redesign -- and plain English -- to make legal paperwork intelligible to the rest of us.</description>
So, basically we have public leaders, public officials who are out of control; they are writing bills that are unintelligible, and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity, which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.
If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits; if you're trying to get a small business loan, you face a blizzard of paperwork.
What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity, transparency and empathy, building humanity into communications.
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.
I come out of the advertising and design business.
My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands.
So, very quickly, when President Obama said, "I don't see why we can't have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."
So, I locked myself in a room, figured out the content, organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.
I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country.
This is a real thing.
Now, I went one step further and said, "Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document? Let's go online."
And many people might need help in computation.
Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.
How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?
But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids.
And what about terms like "over the limit"?
Perhaps a stealth thing.
Define it in context. Tell people what it means.
When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk.
Plain English is about changing the content.
And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM.
It's a grid, it's a calendar.
At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities, you have responsibilities.
Received very favorably by business.
And there is some good news to report today.
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS.
There are 200 million letters that go out.
Running through this typical letter that they had, I ran it through my simplicity lab, it's pretty unintelligible.
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English.
They have been tested in the laboratory.
When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible.
And the IRS has introduced the program.
There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention.
There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency, how to mandate simplicity.
We see all this complexity.
It's incumbent upon us, and this organization, I believe, to make clarity, transparency and empathy a national priority.
There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate.
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.
So, how are we going to change the world?
Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.
I thank you.

<title>Jack Horner: Building a dinosaur from a chicken</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Renowned paleontologist Jack Horner has spent his career trying to reconstruct a dinosaur. He's found fossils with extraordinarily well-preserved blood vessels and soft tissues, but never intact DNA. So, in a new approach, he's taking living descendants of the dinosaur and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits — including teeth, tails, and even hands — to make a "Chickenosaurus".</description>
When I was growing up in Montana, I had two dreams.
I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life.
I was very fortunate early in my career.
I was fortunate in finding things.
I wasn't very good at reading things.
In fact, I don't read much of anything.
I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do.
But instead, I go out and I find things.
Then I just pick things up.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things.
And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones.
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years.
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.
And so, at that time, I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.
We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds.
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals.
In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults.
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.
And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures.
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
You all know the story, right.
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out.
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it.
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.
And everybody's happy about that.
And they're happy over and over again.
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
And then, then, then, and then ...
Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire.
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.
So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos.
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
Now if you want dinosaur DNA, I say go to the dinosaur.
So that's what we've done.
Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.
And one of my former doctoral students, Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing.
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there.
They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world, like red blood cells.
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.
And so she thought, well, what the heck.
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin.
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project.
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them.
And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.
And we did find a lot of stuff.
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex.
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex.
And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16.
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet.
But this one died at the age of 16.
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone.
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant.
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.
Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left.
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
It was extraordinary.
But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones.
And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins.
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples.
And we did. We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast.
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur.
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."
"You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."
"The chicken is not."
So this is our problem, as you can imagine.
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
But the sixth-graders demand it.
"Fix the chicken."
So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken.
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.
Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools.
We'll call them biological modification tools.
We have selection.
And we know selection works.
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese.
I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification.
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow.
And that's pretty cool.
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens.
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine, Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms.
And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.
He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing.
He's looking for those genes as well.
And I said, "Well, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."
And so he agreed.
And so that's what we're looking into.
If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand.
But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing.
But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
It has the three fingers, the three digits.
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus.
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
And people always say, "Why do that?
Why make this thing?
What good is it?"
Well, that's a good question.
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things.
And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece.
Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design.
Thank you.

Today's its debut.
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.
They are live and reacting to me in real time.
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.
So fingers crossed.
And keep your eyes on the big screen.
Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer-generated imagery.
It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask, why, in a technological age, we continue to have this magical sense of wonder.
Magic is deception, but it is a deception we enjoy.
To enjoy being deceived, an audience must first suspend its disbelief.
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith.
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience.
Without it, a script is just words.
Augmented reality is just the latest technology.
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity.
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.
We do it every day, while reading novels, watching television or going to the movies.
We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had.
Without this ability there is no magic.
It was Jean Robert-Houdin, France's greatest illusionist, who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller.
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.
MT: Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story.
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.
There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome.
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.
Magicians play with fire and steel, defy the fury of the buzzsaw, dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape.
But audiences don't come to see the magician die, they come to see him live.
Because the best stories always have a happy ending.
The tricks of magic have one special element.
They are stories with a twist.
Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines.
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think.
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error.
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable, but do not, in fact, match what is being done in front of them.
MT: In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes.
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination.
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected, we laugh.
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks.
The finale defies logic, gives new insight into the problem, and audiences express their amazement with laughter.
It's fun to be fooled.
One of the key qualities of all stories is that they're made to be shared.
We feel compelled to tell them.
When I do a trick at a party -- that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again.
They want to share the experience.
That makes my job more difficult, because, if I want to surprise them, I need to tell a story that starts the same, but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist.
It keeps me busy.
Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.
We think in narrative structures.
We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood.
It's a uniquely human achievement.
We all want to share our stories, whether it is the trick we saw at the party, the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.
Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets, on TED.com.
The tools of social networking, these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story.
We turn facts into similes and metaphors, and even fantasies.
We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole.
Our stories make us the people we are and, sometimes, the people we want to be.
They give us our identity and a sense of community.
And if the story is a good one, it might even make us smile.
Thank you.
Thank you.

<title>Chip Kidd: Designing books is no laughing matter. OK, it is.</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Chip Kidd doesn’t judge books by their cover, he creates covers that embody the book -- and he does it with a wicked sense of humor. In one of the funniest talks from TED2012, he shows the art and deep thought of his cover designs. This talk is from The Design Studio session at TED2012, guest-curated by Chee Pearlman and David Rockwell.</description>
Hi.
I did that for two reasons.
First of all, I wanted to give you a good visual first impression.
But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic.
I'm used to a stationary mic.
It's the sensible shoe of public address.
But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.
I just become skanky.
So I'm sorry about that.
And I'm already off-message.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have devoted the past 25 years of my life to designing books.
("Yes, BOOKS. You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.
You cannot turn them off with a switch.
Tell your kids.") It all sort of started as a benign mistake, like penicillin.
What I really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in New York City.
But upon arrival there, in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews, I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf, a book publisher.
Now I was stupid, but not so stupid that I turned it down.
I had absolutely no idea what I was about to become part of, and I was incredibly lucky.
Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.
My job was to ask this question: "What do the stories look like?"
Because that is what Knopf is.
It is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.
We bring stories to the public.
The stories can be anything, and some of them are actually true.
But they all have one thing in common: They all need to look like something.
They all need a face.
Why? To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into.
A book designer gives form to content, but also manages a very careful balance between the two.
Now, the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University, the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard, and wrote the word "Apple" underneath, and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up."
And he covered up the picture and he said, "You either say this," and then he covered up the word, "or you show this.
But you don't do this."
Because this is treating your audience like a moron.
And they deserve better.
And lo and behold, soon enough, I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf.
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs, and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style, it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter; it was a biography.
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.
So there you are.
Pure content and pure form, side by side.
No fighting, ladies.
Now, what is the story here?
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber.
Genius!
Now, luckily for me, I live and work in New York City, where there are plenty of dinosaurs.
So, I went to the Museum of Natural History, and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop, and I bought a book.
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book, and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.
Now I took this diagram, and I put it in a Photostat machine, and I took a piece of tracing paper, and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast -- -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters -- and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.
I had no idea what I was doing, I had no idea where I was going, but at some point, I stopped -- when to keep going would seem like I was going too far.
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being.
We're in the middle of the process.
And then I just threw some typography on it.
Very basic stuff, slightly suggestive of public park signage.
Everybody in house loved it, and so off it goes to the author.
And even back then, Michael was on the cutting edge.
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.
I miss Michael.
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image, just in case they might want to use it.
Well, they used it.
And I was thrilled.
We all know it was an amazing movie, and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it.
But not too long ago, I came upon this on the Web.
No, that is not me.
But whoever it is, I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like, "Oh my God, that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh!
I was so wasted."
But if you think about it, from my head to my hands to his leg.
That's a responsibility.
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.
The book designer's responsibility is threefold: to the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.
I want you to look at the author's book and say, "Wow! I need to read that."
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers, and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.
And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image, and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of.
But when you do, you don't get what you expect.
You get something that goes much deeper than that.
And David especially loved this design because at book signings, which he does a lot of, he could take a magic marker and do this.
Hello!
Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.
In his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive, and as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.
He did not think so, however, but his coworkers did an intervention and they said, "You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution, what I would call the opposite of Type 101.
What does that mean?
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography, you get the assignment of, select a word and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?
Very simple stuff.
This is going to be the opposite of that.
I want this book to look like it's lying to you, desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!
Then when we went to press, the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running.
Not long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books.
And this woman came up to it, and she squinted, and she took it to the register, and she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."
And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way."
Now, that's a good printing job.
A book cover is a distillation.
It is a haiku, if you will, of the story.
This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha, and it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is when it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life of the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.
All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book, but once the book designer has read the text, then he has to be an interpreter and a translator.
This story was a real puzzle.
This is what it's about.
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together.
And so, here's the design, right?
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.
Ahh! We come upon them, the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.
Huhh! They've been discovered by the sultan.
He will not be pleased.
Huhh! And now the sultan is in danger.
And now, we have to open it up to find out what's going to happen next.
Try experiencing that on a Kindle.
Don't get me started.
Seriously.
Much is to be gained by eBooks: ease, convenience, portability.
But something is definitely lost: tradition, a sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity.
Do you know what John Updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf?
He'd smell it.
Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper, and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.
All those years, all those books, he never got tired of it.
Now, I am all for the iPad, but trust me -- smelling it will get you nowhere.
Now the Apple guys are texting, "Develop odor emission plug-in."
And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom, she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden, she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left, but very similar, but different.
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence, sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.
So how do we show this?
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them.
So we're talking about different planes, different pieces of paper.
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.
It's one part of the form and content.
When it's on top of the paper board, which is the opposite, it forms this.
So even if you don't know anything about this book, you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence.
And the object itself invited exploration interaction, consideration and touch.
This debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list.
This is unheard of, both for us the publisher, and the author.
We're talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling, and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode.
Not exactly Jackie Collins.
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list, eight printings, and still going strong.
So even though we love publishing as an art, we very much know it's a business too, and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky, that great art can be great business.
So that's my story. To be continued.
What does it look like?
Yes. It can, it does and it will, but for this book designer, page-turner, dog-eared place-holder, notes in the margins-taker, ink-sniffer, the story looks like this.
Thank you.

<title>Aicha el-Wafi + Phyllis Rodriguez: The mothers who found forgiveness, friendship</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Phyllis Rodriguez and Aicha el-Wafi have a powerful friendship born of unthinkable loss. Rodriguez' son was killed in the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001; el-Wafi's son Zacarias Moussaoui was convicted of a role in those attacks and is serving a life sentence. In hoping to find peace, these two moms have come to understand and respect one another.</description>
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.
And it is.
And yet, it feels natural to us now.
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001.
We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later.
At the time, we knew that it was political.
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
And when I saw it -- and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful.
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly.
Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families.
When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, "What a brave woman.
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength.
I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other.
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy.
But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy.
But her suffering is equal to mine.
So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about.
Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
So they introduced me to five families.
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
She was the only mother in the group.
The others were brothers, sisters.
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me.
I suffered a lot as a mother.
I was married when I was 14.
I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16.
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive.
I know she really cried for her son.
But she knows where he is.
My son, I don't know where he is.
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.
I don't know what happened to him.
So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change.
It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children.
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children.
I talk against violence, against terrorism.
I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good.
This is why I'm here in front of you.
PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members.
But we were all so nervous.
"Why does she want to meet us?"
And then she was nervous.
"Why did we want to meet her?"
What did we want from each other?
Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept.
Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
And Aicha started, and she said, "I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.
I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished."
But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings.
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had.
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much.
And I think it's all about being afraid of the other, but making that step and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"
So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion?
Because our time is up.
AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other.
You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous.
You must be tolerant.
You have to fight against violence.
And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other.
This is what I wanted to say.

<title>Graham Hill: Why I'm a weekday vegetarian</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We all know the arguments that being vegetarian is better for the environment and for the animals -- but in a carnivorous culture, it can be hard to make the change. Graham Hill has a powerful, pragmatic suggestion: Be a weekday veg.</description>
About a year ago, I asked myself a question: "Knowing what I know, why am I not a vegetarian?"
After all, I'm one of the green guys: I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.
I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this stuff.
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third.
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider for our own cats, dogs and other pets.
Environmentally, meat, amazingly, causes more emissions than all of transportation combined: cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do.
I also knew that I'm not alone.
We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s.
So what was once the special little side treat now is the main, much more regular.
So really, any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.
Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk -- tucking into a big old steak.
So why was I stalling?
I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution.
It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian, and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.
Imagine your last hamburger.
So my common sense, my good intentions, were in conflict with my taste buds.
And I'd commit to doing it later, and not surprisingly, later never came.
Sound familiar?
So I wondered, might there be a third solution?
And I thought about it, and I came up with one.
I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.
It's called weekday veg.
The name says it all: Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.
On the weekend, your choice.
Simple.
If you want to take it to the next level, remember, the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats.
So you want to swap those out with some good, sustainably harvested fish.
It's structured, so it ends up being simple to remember, and it's okay to break it here and there.
After all, cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.
The program has been great, weekday veg.
My footprint's smaller, I'm lessening pollution, I feel better about the animals, I'm even saving money.
Best of all, I'm healthier, I know that I'm going to live longer, and I've even lost a little weight.
So, please ask yourselves, for your health, for your pocketbook, for the environment, for the animals: What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?
After all, if all of us ate half as much meat, it would be like half of us were vegetarians.
Thank you.

<title>Jonathan Eisen: Meet your microbes</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Our bodies are covered in a sea of microbes -- both the pathogens that make us sick and the "good" microbes, about which we know less, that might be keeping us healthy. At TEDMED, microbiologist Jonathan Eisen shares what we know, including some surprising ways to put those good microbes to work.</description>
I'm going to start with a little story.
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old, I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete, over four months, slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst.
I had basically digested away my body.
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip, my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog.
That night, I was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine, insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.
And something festered inside me after this happened.
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin.
And this is what I thought for a long period of time, and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit, the microbes that do bad things.
And that's where I need my assistant here now.
You may recognize her.
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks, and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building, and they sell toys, giant microbes.
And here we go!
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us, and that's what I was focusing on.
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes, and those microbes actually do us good much of the time, rather than killing us.
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us, I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...
The microbes that cover us.
And if you look at them in the microscope, you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells.
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms, just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their DNA.
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years, using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places, including the human body, reading the DNA sequence and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place.
And what's amazing, when you use this technology, for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered in a sea of microbes.
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us.
And so this microbial diversity differs between people, and what people have been thinking about in the last 10, maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes, this microbial cloud in and on us, and the variation between us, may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us.
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen, but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you.
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body.
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is, what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques in particular, to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us.
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.
My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave, right around the corner from here at Georgetown.
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk, and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people.
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.
And so I started a collaboration with this person, Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project.
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease, and they sterilized the donor ileum.
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.
They did this because this was common practice in medicine, even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea.
And fortunately, in the course of this project, the transplant surgeons and the other people decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor, and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant.
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.
In the last few years there's been a great expansion in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project that's going on in the United States, and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.
And when people have done a variety of studies, they have learned things such as, when a baby is born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother.
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections, some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal.
And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system, helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism, and determining our metabolic rate, probably determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways.
And so, these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community, this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.
And one area that I think is very interesting, which many of you may have now that we've thrown microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."
So people are really into cleanliness, right?
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters, people are washing every part of them all of the time, we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities, we take antibiotics excessively.
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick, but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children, has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community.
So the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not, or we can kill it with antibiotics, but what can we do to restore it?
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you.
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat, prevent, necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants.
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them, and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.
So what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is, they eat poo -- coprophagia.
And it turns out that many veterinarians, old school veterinarians in particular, have been doing something called "poo tea," not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that, where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side, and you can put your hand into its rumen, it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system, so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants, where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth, they are delivering a community of probiotics, a community of microbes from a healthy donor, through the other end.
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years.
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces, from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic C. dif infections in some people.
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people have come up with this same idea, is that the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.
We should treat it carefully and with respect, and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness, without some real good justification.
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little, and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences.
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not just correlative differences, but causative.
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this, but people are now using these technologies because they've gotten very cheap, to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is, I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.
It turns out that my father was an M.D., actually studied hormones. I told him many times that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology meeting as family in Quebec.
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee, and drinking everybody's water at the table, and I think they all thought I was a druggie.
But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community, my father as an example, sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.
They're microbes. They're tiny.
But we can see them through their DNA, we can see them through the effects that they have on people.
And what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine.
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us, but it might.
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people, so that we can understand what they're doing to our lives.
We are them. They are us.
Thank you.

<title>Tierney Thys: Swim with the giant sunfish</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Marine biologist Tierney Thys asks us to step into the water to visit the world of the Mola mola, or giant ocean sunfish. Basking, eating jellyfish and getting massages, this behemoth offers clues to life in the open sea.</description>
I'd like to start tonight by something completely different, asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean, and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
And it's a lively and a lovely place, but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing, our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland, but also, most recently, with climate change, and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans, more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful, and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday, but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up.
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
So it may be good for the waistline, but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish.
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish.
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records" for being the world's heaviest bony fish.
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish -- that its favorite food is the moon jelly.
So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way, even if one is eating the other.
Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name.
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior, they lie out and bask on the surface.
Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian, but it's actually Latin for millstone, and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.
And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place, was this terribly bizarre shape.
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek, and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength, and then you look at the sunfish.
And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution.
The Mola's no exception.
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs, and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction -- oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know, about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs -- we're going to head to the high seas.
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing, and we turn our puffer into the Mola.
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.
They look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps, but in fact, in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea, right up there with flat fish.
They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.
And in terms of fishes -- fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so -- so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.
They start as little eggs, and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs, can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine -- and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
And from that little egg, they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry, and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
That's a little diver up there in the corner.
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.
600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby, and you had to feed this thing.
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but -- we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
I said, now, that's a true American.
So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas, because schooling used to be salvation for fishes, but it's suicide for fishes now.
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school, they still get caught in nets as by-catch.
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination, then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives, like the Mola.
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch -- up to 26 percent of the drift net.
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries, they make up up to 90 percent.
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
And how do you do that?
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.
This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.
How do you get insight?
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
Well, there's some great new technology that has just recently become available, and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity, which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have -- we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.
But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.
They don't seem to mind, so far.
So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents, using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
We'd love to tag in Monterey.
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
Not this time of year -- it's more around October.
And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey -- but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay, rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style, and then tosses them back and forth.
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds, so we head down south, to San Diego.
Not so many California sea lions down there.
And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily, and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there.
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
And they come and give the Molas -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says, "I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head, and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean -- because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right, will say, "Okay, scratch me right there."
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle -- and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific; we've gone over to another part of the Pacific, and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
Well, not the one we tagged!
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone, to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording.
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars, so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.
They're not big migrators. This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.
And that's kind of their home range.
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure, that population doesn't get replenished.
So that's a very important piece of data.
But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.
They're super industrious.
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we -- they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day.
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade, and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.
They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power, and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food's in that layer.
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker, they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas, a real three-dimensional play.
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life, where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that.
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.
Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
But people would write into the site with all sorts of, all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared -- a shared love and an interest in the oceans.
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns, Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in, united by their love of life.
And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself: "One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.

<title>Taryn Simon: Photographs of secret sites</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Taryn Simon exhibits her startling take on photography -- to reveal worlds and people we would never see otherwise. She shares two projects: one documents otherworldly locations typically kept secret from the public, the other involves haunting portraits of men convicted for crimes they did not commit.</description>
Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic.
It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia.
And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence: "Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to."
Photography threatens fantasy.
They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth.
But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.
Over a five year period following September 11th, when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction, I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation, mythology and daily functioning.
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.
It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph.
And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
And the outsider can never really reach the core.
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
It's titled, "An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar," and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.
In this context I'll just show you a few.
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State, where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water.
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.
And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America, which you can see here.
And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text.
So I create these two poles.
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.
And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image.
So, at best, the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground.
But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts.
This is a cryopreservation unit, and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger, who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health, with advancements in science and technology, all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty.
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state, allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage.
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen, allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse, to simulate the loss of virginity.
This is a jury simulation deliberation room, and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.
And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for.
This process costs 60,000 dollars.
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room, a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
On that table you can see 48 hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.
There is a pig's head and African cane rats.
And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there.
I do take certain liberties and intervene.
And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting, so I spent some time with the smells and items.
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.
And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.
And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics.
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.
This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility, and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition.
And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene.
This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States.
It's a research crop marijuana grow room.
And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things -- they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security -- and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed.
These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, connecting North America to Europe.
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability.
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed.
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.
And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired, and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity.
And Playboy is always in the top few.
But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.
This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine, where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza.
This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.
And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States.
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.
All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding -- that would be mother to son, father to daughter, sister to brother -- to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger.
Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.
And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth.
It's a very violent process that is little known.
And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.
Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.
He has since passed away, but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.
This, on a lighter note, is at George Lucas' personal archive.
This is the Death Star.
And it's shown here in its true orientation.
In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi," its mirror image is presented.
They flip the negative.
And you can see the photoetched brass detailing, and the painted acrylic facade.
In the context of the film, this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire, capable of annihilating planets and civilizations, and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.
It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.
Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat, and this is one of the structures that exists in that city.
It's called the World Church of God.
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.
And after I took this photograph, they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.
And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice.
And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army.
And I put them into my photograph.
This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity.
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq.
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.
It's titled "The Innocents."
And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy.
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.
I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction, and its influence on memory, which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.
For the men in these photographs, the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification.
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images.
But through exposure to composite sketches, Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups, eyewitness testimony can change.
I'll give you an example from a case.
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker.
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs, but couldn't quite make a positive identification.
Days later, she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs, except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.
And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory, if there ever was an actual memory.
Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals, and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications.
Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.
He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.
Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison.
But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school.
He served 18 years of a death sentence.
I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho.
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction.
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location.
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.
So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction, in both his life and in photography.
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.
Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest, where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana, in this very room to hide from the police.
He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.
The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification, days later, from a photo array.
Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.
He is photographed at his alibi location.
Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club, and served 11 years of a death sentence.
I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction.
And the state's key witness in Ron's case was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.
Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime, was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence, for several charges of rape and robbery.
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery, and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.
Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old.
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived.
That's it. Thank you.

<title>Ed Boyden: A light switch for neurons</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ed Boyden shows how, by inserting genes for light-sensitive proteins into brain cells, he can selectively activate or de-activate specific neurons with fiber-optic implants. With this unprecedented level of control, he's managed to cure mice of analogs of PTSD and certain forms of blindness. On the horizon: neural prosthetics. Session host Juan Enriquez leads a brief post-talk Q&amp;A.</description>
Think about your day for a second.
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door, encountered new colleagues and had great discussions, and felt in awe when you found something new.
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all.
And that's that all the sensations, feelings, decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain.
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain, and to see the intricacy of what lies within.
And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.
Now unlike a human-designed computer, where there's a fairly small number of different parts -- we know how they work, because we humans designed them -- the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells, maybe tens of thousands.
They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules.
And they project and connect to different brain regions, and they also change different ways in different disease states.
Let's make it concrete.
There's a class of cells, a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.
It's called the basket cell.
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about.
New ones are being discovered everyday.
As just a second example: these pyramidal cells, large cells, they can span a significant fraction of the brain.
They're excitatory.
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device.
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs, which then, if they pass a certain threshold, will go to thousands of downstream partners.
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so, happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells, as long as you live and think and feel.
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?
Ideally, we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.
If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash, what they can initiate and sustain.
If we could turn them off, then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.
And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today.
And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years, through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off, both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans.
Now before I tell you about the technology, the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room, if we live long enough, will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them, and the numbers don't do it justice though.
These disorders -- schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, depression, addiction -- they not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people.
Now in the 20th century, there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders, and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders, practically none of them can be considered to be cured.
And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical.
This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance.
That's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too.
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.
And for Parkinson's disease, Cochlear implants, these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder.
But electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance, which is where that phrase, in part, comes from.
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.
So again, we're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control.
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?
So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago, I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist, and the first thing I thought about was, if these neurons are electrical devices, all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance.
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell, but not its neighbors, that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells, figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded.
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry.
Now how are we going to do that?
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature, which are able to convert light into electricity.
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells.
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow, then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.
And their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not.
There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen, and that's the ability to get light into the brain.
And to do that -- the brain doesn't feel pain -- you can put -- taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on -- optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate, in animal models for example, in pre-clinical studies, these neurons and to see what they do.
So how do we do this?
Around 2004, in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth, this vision came to fruition.
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild, and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally.
And it senses light with a little eye-spot, which works not unlike how our eye works.
In its membrane, or its boundary, it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity.
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.
When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot, and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery.
So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons.
And because it's a protein, it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.
So all we've got to do is take that DNA, put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus, and put it into neurons.
So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy, and lots of viruses were coming along.
So this turned out to be very simple to do.
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004, we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell, like putting solar panels on a roof, you have a neuron which can be activated with light.
So this is very powerful.
One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors.
And you can do that; you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others.
And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells.
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics.
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do, you can take a complex network, use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network.
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated.
So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier -- the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory.
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course -- and then flash blue light over the entire brain network, just these cells are going to be driven.
And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal, so they don't seem to be averse against that.
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do, what their power is in computing in the brain, but you can also use this to try to figure out -- well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells, if indeed they're atrophied.
Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this, both at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.
One of the questions we've confronted is, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?
Because if you could find those, those would be some of the signals that could drive learning.
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward.
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.
So if we could figure out what cells they are, we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against, or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability.
So to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group, where one side of this little box, if the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.
So if these cells can mediate reward, the animal should go there more and more.
And so that's what happens.
This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there, and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.
And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.
These are the dopamine neurons, which some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.
Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough, indeed, to drive learning.
Now we can generalize the idea.
Instead of one point in the brain, we can devise devices that span the brain, that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns -- arrays of optical fibers, each coupled to its own independent miniature light source.
And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish -- like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen.
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders.
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear.
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock.
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.
And over time -- in this case, a mouse, which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone.
The animal will react by freezing, sort of like a deer in the headlights.
Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear?
So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear.
But we activate targets in the brain, different ones, using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide, in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.
And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now.
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex, a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.
And the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there.
There's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing.
This tone used to mean bad news.
And there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner, so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later.
And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.
Okay, there it goes. Right now.
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment, that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory.
Now over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.
If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds, you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded.
And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.
And we found all sorts of molecules, they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins, that respond to green and yellow light.
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.
Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.
Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy, where the brain is overactive.
Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment, one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.
But that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time, until the seizure dies away, and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state -- sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state.
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light, and we beam light in, and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure, we're hoping to be able to turn it off.
And so we don't have data to show you on this front, but we're very excited about this.
Now I want to close on one story, which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control, can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.
Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants, which allow them to hear.
There's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells.
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus, which probably most of us around this room have, and it doesn't have any symptoms, which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body.
And so far, there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus.
There's one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves, which come from algae and bacteria and fungi, and all over the tree of life.
Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains, so what is our brain going to do if we put that in?
Are the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react?
In its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet -- but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this, and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light.
So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it.
I wanted to close with one story, which we think could potentially be a clinical application.
Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors, our light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.
And the retina, of course, is a complex structure.
Now let's zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top, and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells, relay the information to the brain, where we see that as perception.
In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa, or macular degeneration, the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.
Now how could you repair this?
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored, because there's nothing for the drug to bind to.
On the other hand, light can still get into the eye.
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in.
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras.
And because there's so many of these cells in the eye, potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.
So this is some work that we're doing.
It's being led by one of our collaborators, Alan Horsager at USC, and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience, which is funded by the NIH.
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.
It's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there.
And the goal, of course, of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port.
Now mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually, but he does a brute-force search.
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.
So he's not using vision to do it.
These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.
And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach.
So how are we going to solve this?
We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive.
Light is converted to electricity on them.
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again.
And to point out the power of this: these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.
So this pre-clinical study, I think, bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future.
To close, I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology.
We're developing these tools, but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world, so people can study and try to treat different disorders.
And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them, we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier, practically none of which are cured, and in the 21st century make them history.
Thank you.
Juan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.
But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs, and being able to target those specifically is a first step.
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors, like an on/off switch.
Ed Boyden: That's right.
JE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.
EB: Right, yeah.
So with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.
And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities.
JE: And in theory, that means that, as a mouse feels, smells, hears, touches, you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros.
EB: Sure, yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings, and use that to understand more about the brain.
JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them?
EB: Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard.
We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.
So we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing.
JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you.

<title>Ueli Gegenschatz: Extreme wingsuit flying</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Wingsuit jumping is the leading edge of extreme sports -- an exhilarating feat of almost unbelievable daring, where skydivers soar through canyons at over 100MPH. Ueli Gegenschatz talks about how he does it, and shows jawdropping film.</description>
I started with paragliding.
Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider, with the possibility to fly cross-country, distance, just with the use of thermals to soar.
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider.
From there I started with skydiving.
In this picture you can see there is a four-way skydive, four people flying together, and on the left hand side it's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump, for the film itself and also for the judging.
From regular, relative skydiving I went on to freeflying.
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.
You can see the skydiver with the red suit, he's in a stand-up position.
The one with the yellow-green suit, he's flying head-down.
And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation in freefall also, with the helmet cam to film this jump.
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.
You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board, there is a lot of force, a lot of power.
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.
Wingsuit flying is a suit, that I can make fly, just only with my body.
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit, I can make it fly. And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface.
With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance.
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.
From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects, like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth -- meaning mountains, cliffs.
It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall, with all the visual references.
So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before.
So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland.
Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn, a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here.
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau, three very famous mountains in Switzerland.
The special thing on these three jumps were, I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
So with all this knowledge, I also wanted to get into stunts.
So with some friends we started to do different tricks, like for example this jump here, I jumped from a paraglider.
Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me, because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming.
Everybody sitting in a basket, and I was on top of the balloon, ready to slide down with my skysurf board.
Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.
Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step, if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge.
Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition, so I'm training a lot.
You need to have the best possible equipment.
And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.
And all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly.
So for 2009, I'm training hard for my two new projects.
The first one, I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.
And I want to set a new record, with the longest distance ever flown.
For my second project, I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before.
So now, on the following movie you will see that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English.
Enjoy, and thank you very much.
June Cohen: I have some questions.
I think we all might have some questions.
Question one: so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does?
Because it looks like it might.
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.
JC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?
UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute just seconds before, I would say, impact.
It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.
JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?
UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.
We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance, to get more knowledge.
And I believe soon.
JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.
What is the -- there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?
UE: Nope. It's just smoke.
JC: Coming off of you?
UE: Hopefully not.
JC: That seems dangerous.
UE: No, smoke is for two reasons, you can see the speed, you can see the way where I was flying.
That's reason number one. And reason number two: it's much easier for the camera guy to film If I'm using smoke.
JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked. One more question.
What do you do to to cover your face?
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards.
Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?
UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.
JC: And is that how you usually fly?
UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet because of landings -- usually it's difficult -- it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.
So you have to be prepared.
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?
Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"
and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."
UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and -- JC: ...a round of applause...
UE: Thank you very much.

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Recent events have highlighted, underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity -- whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. This means that, essentially, every international user of the internet is being watched, says Mikko Hypponen. An important rant, wrapped with a plea: to find alternative solutions to using American companies for the world's information needs.</description>
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone.
They've changed the world.
However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state.
It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world.
We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6.
Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others.
And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world.
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist.
We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined.
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah.
Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center.
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting.
And it's a pretty big building.
How big? Well, I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn't really tell you very much.
Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.
You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in.
This is five times larger.
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
Right? It's pretty big.
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades.
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all.
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone.
Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners.
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States.
And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.
In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.
Right?
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.
But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay.
I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine.
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications.
I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings.
They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent.
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.
And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already.
Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didn't know this was happening.
Now we know for a fact it's happening.
We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM.
We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.
We didn't know about DoubleArrow.
We did not know about Skywriter -- all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies.
But now we do.
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.
And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file.
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years.
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result.
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind.
But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job.
This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic.
That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption.
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose.
They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control.
So what do we actually know about the leaks?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden.
The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to.
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers.
So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on.
And every single one of these companies denies.
They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data.
Yet we have these files.
So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation?
And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating.
Instead, they've been hacked.
That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.
In this case, they've been hacked by their own government.
That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government.
And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well.
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies.
Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium.
And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual.
Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming.
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub.
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, "Success," when they gain access to services like this.
What the hell?
And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well.
All countries spy.
And maybe that's true.
Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example.
Let's take, for example, Sweden.
I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.
When your data traffic goes through Sweden, their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic.
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support?
And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day.
And then we turn it around.
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services?
And the answer is zero.
So this is not balanced.
It's not balanced by any means, not even close.
And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States.
Like, Skype used to be secure.
It used to be end-to-end encrypted.
Then it was sold to the United States.
Today, it no longer is secure.
So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome.
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists.
It's the war on terror.
You shouldn't worry about it.
Well, it's not the war on terror.
Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?
It's not the war on terror.
Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists?
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom?
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all?
But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide.
Feel free to survey me if that helps.
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough.
Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret.
But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this.
And I have nothing to hide.
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency.
And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother.
And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence.
And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?
What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something?
And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either.
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.
Privacy is nonnegotiable.
It should be built in to all the systems we use.
And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines.
You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes.
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families.
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you.
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States.
And surveillance changes history.
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon.
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today.
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.
Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, "If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy."
That's what it's about.
Privacy is the building block of our democracies.
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies.
So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters.
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming.
So, what is there to be done?
Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry.
We should be angry, because this is wrong, and it's rude, and it should not be done.
But that's not going to really change the situation.
What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States.
And that's much easier said than done.
How do you do that?
A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.
But maybe you don't have to do it alone.
Maybe you can do it together with other countries.
The solution is open source.
By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself.
It only has to solve one little problem.
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state.
Thank you very much.

<title>Eric Sanderson: New York -- before the City</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: 400 years after Hudson found New York harbor, Eric Sanderson shares how he made a 3D map of Mannahatta's fascinating pre-city ecology of hills, rivers, wildlife -- accurate down to the block -- when Times Square was a wetland and you couldn't get delivery.</description>
The substance of things unseen.
Cities, past and future.
In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves, or perhaps pass through to another world.
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, "As the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh green breast of the new world."
My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project.
We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609, when he sailed into New York harbor.
And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts, and if I have time still, an epilogue.
So, Act I: A Map Found.
So, I didn't grow up in New York.
I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here, in the Red Rock Canyon.
And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes.
And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies, I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology.
Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals.
This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world.
And over the last decade, I traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos.
But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals?
How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them.
I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan.
I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City.
I read that New York City was the first mega-city, a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950.
I started seeing paintings like this.
For those of you who are from New York, this is 125th street under the West Side Highway.
It was once a beach. And this painting has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock.
And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.
Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village.
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree.
What's that palm tree doing there?
So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map.
And it's this map you see here.
It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in.
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City.
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.
And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was, right at the end of the American Revolution.
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.
And this is City Hall Park.
So the city basically extended to City Hall Park.
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared.
This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first 200 years, and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that.
You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now, and the beaches that come up from the Battery, all the way to 42nd St.
This map was made for military reasons.
They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications that they built.
But they're also mapping things of ecological interest, also military interest: the hills, the marshes, the streams.
This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water, which used to run its way through Greenwich Village.
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.
Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.
Here is Times Square, the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat."
So, after some work we were able to georeference it, which allows us to put the modern streets on the city, and the buildings, and the open spaces, so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.
We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams, and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today.
So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography.
But I had another idea about this map.
If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings, and if we take away the open spaces, then we could take this map.
If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time.
We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals: to the hills, to the streams, to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches, the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.
Then, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology, and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave, if we make the soil map, with the 17 soil classes, that are defined by the National Conservation Service, if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were, then we can calculate the slopes.
We can calculate the aspect.
We can calculate the winter wind exposure -- so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape.
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.
We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.
And we built a probability map of where they might have been.
So, the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan, places that are close to water, places that are near the harbor to fish, places protected from the winter winds.
We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond.
And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture, that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash, the "Three Sisters" garden.
So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been.
And the old fields, the successional fields that go.
And we might think of these as abandoned.
But, in fact, they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants.
And they have become successional shrub lands, and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.
And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.
You can think of these as neighborhoods, as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood -- that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities, the beaches.
And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis, Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.
So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.
So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan, the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore, the beavers on all the streams, the black bears, and the Native Americans, to study how they used and thought about their landscape.
We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs.
Where do they get their food?
Where do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter?
Where do they get their reproductive resources?
To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat, but to most people, the intersection of these is their home.
So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves, you know, what beavers need is, "A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water." That's the best thing for a beaver.
So we just started making a list.
Here is the beaver. And here is the stream, and the aspen and the alder and the willow.
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver.
Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.
Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites.
And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs.
But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species.
Moreover, we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist, but you can look up what an aspen needs.
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.
And you can look at what a wet meadow needs.
And it need beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things.
But you can also talk about sunny places.
So, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se.
But what are the conditions that make it possible?
Or fire. Or dry soils.
And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.
And then we can visualize this data like a network, like a social network.
And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan, and everything they needed, going back to the geology, going back to time and space at the very core of the web.
We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.
Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type.
And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.
They are the connections that actually make nature resilient.
And the structure of this is what makes nature work, seen with all its parts.
We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist John Muir, who said, "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."
So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps.
So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th, and Lex and Third, maybe there was a stream in that block.
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there, and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses, the butterflies, the fish in the stream, the birds in the trees.
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there.
And then we took this data.
You can see this for yourself on our website.
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago.
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III.
We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.
So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.
We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape.
We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities.
And feed into that the map of the species.
So that we would actually take a photograph, flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River, waiting for Hudson to come.
Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views.
We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.
This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today.
This is the view looking down the Hudson River, with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right, looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
This is the view over Times Square, with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east.
So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind.
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made.
And we can see this in the geography of the city today.
So when you're watching "Law and Order," and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond, 400 years ago.
So these images are the work of my friend and colleague, Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today.
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work.
There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.
The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.
But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city and its kind of diversity, and its resilience, and its dependence on density and how we're connected together.
In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other, much as Lewis Carroll did in "Through the Looking Glass."
We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time, that they really are the same place, that there is no way that cities can escape from nature.
And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.
So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past, but about 400 years from now, what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people, and need to supply what people need: a sense of home, food, water, shelter, reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning.
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.
And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids.
So, how can we envision the city of the future?
Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park, and we imagine it without all the cars, and bicycles instead and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains?
What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs, and streams winding through the city, and windmills supplying the power we need?
Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area, currently home to 12 million people, but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan, in only 36 percent of the area, with the areas in between covered by farmland, covered by wetlands, covered by the marshes we need.
This is the kind of future I think we need, is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan, but that learns from the sustainability of the past, of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts.
Thank you very much.

<title>Charlie Todd: The shared experience of absurdity</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Charlie Todd causes bizarre, hilarious, and unexpected public scenes: Seventy synchronized dancers in storefront windows, "ghostbusters" running through the New York Public Library, and the annual no-pants subway ride. His group, Improv Everywhere, uses these scenes to bring people together.</description>
I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.
Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage, so I decided to create my own in public places.
So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.
Now this took place in January of 2002.
And this woman is the star of the video.
She doesn't know she's being filmed.
She's being filmed with a hidden camera.
This is on the 6 train in New York City.
And this is the first stop along the line.
These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera.
And that's me right there in a brown coat.
It's about 30 degrees outside.
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.
And the girl's going to notice me right here.
And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.
So at this point -- at this point she's noticed me, but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car.
One person's not that unusual.
She goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled "Rape."
So she's noticed the unusual thing, but she's gone back to her normal life.
Now in the meantime, I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well.
They're going to be entering this car one by one.
We'll act as though we don't know each other.
And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made, forgetting our pants on this cold January day.
So at this point, she decides to put the rape book away.
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.
Now in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera, they're cracking up.
They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now.
And I love that moment in this video, because before it became a shared experience, it was something that was maybe a little bit scary, or something that was at least confusing to her.
And then once it became a shared experience, it was funny and something that she could laugh at.
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line.
So the video won't show everything.
This goes on for another four stops.
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.
At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train.
We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants, put them on and said, "Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today," and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions.
Thank you.
So that's a still from the video there.
And I love that girl's reaction so much.
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do.
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people.
It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.
And we've continued to do it every year.
This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in New York -- almost every single train line in the city.
And also in 50 other cities around the world, people participated.
As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians, I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects.
So I could do more large-scale projects.
Well one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005.
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.
And it was very peculiar, because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting, and she was very much onstage, and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.
After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away.
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.
So I got inspired by that.
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do.
So this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black.
This was completely unauthorized.
We didn't let the stores know we were coming.
And I stood in the park giving signals.
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out "Look Up More," the name of the project.
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together.
You'll see that start right here.
And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.
And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them.
So then I gave a new hand signal, which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21, and he danced.
There were several other activities.
We had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground.
And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt, putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement.
And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station, there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing.
There's a better photo of it.
So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon.
The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger.
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said, "You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around."
So I wrote this high school kid back immediately, and I said, "Yes, you are correct.
I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."
So here's the video.
So again, this is 2005.
This is the Best Buy in New York City.
We had about 80 people show up to participate, entering one-by-one.
There was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl.
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated.
So a very diverse group of people.
And I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.
But also, don't shop.
Just stand around and don't face products."
Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.
Everybody else is one of our actors.
The lower level employees thought it was very funny.
And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us.
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers.
The managers and the security guards, on the other hand, did not find it particularly funny.
You can see them in this footage.
They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911.
So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming.
And you can see the cops in this footage right here.
That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.
Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.
Thank you.
So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.
One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras.
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop.
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them.
I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason.
And one morning, I was riding the subway.
I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators.
And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded.
So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning.
So this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8:30 in the morning.
It's morning rush hour.
It's very cold outside.
People are coming in from Queens, transferring from the E train to the 6 train.
And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs.
So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.
He gave 2,000 high fives that day, and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick.
And that was done also without permission, although no one seemed to care.
So I'd say over the years, one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is: "These people have too much time on their hands."
And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do, and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments, but that one's always bothered me, because we don't have too much time on our hands.
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way.
You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games.
And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game, saying, "All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."
And of course they don't.
It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon, watching a football game in a stadium.
But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library.
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park, or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical, or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.
And we're never given a reason why we should play.
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.
And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
We don't need a reason.
As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time, then that's enough for us.
And I think, as adults, we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play.
Thank you very much.

<title>Edi Rama: Take back your city with paint</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Make a city beautiful, curb corruption. Edi Rama took this deceptively simple path as mayor of Tirana, Albania, where he instilled pride in his citizens by transforming public spaces with colorful designs. With projects that put the people first, Rama decreased crime -- and showed his citizens they could have faith in their leaders. </description>
In my previous life, I was an artist.
I still paint. I love art.
I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities, and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics, and I see part of my job today, the reason for being here, not just to campaign for my party, but for politics, and the role it can play for the better in our lives.
For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.
We faced many challenges.
Art was part of the answer, and my name, in the very beginning, was linked with two things: demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back, and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city.
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act.
Rather, it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget I had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something.
When we painted the first building, by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade, something unimaginable happened.
There was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident, or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.
The French E.U. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting.
He screeched that he would block the financing.
"But why?" I asked him.
"Because the colors you have ordered do not meet European standards," he replied.
"Well," I told him, "the surroundings do not meet European standards, even though this is not what we want, but we will choose the colors ourselves, because this is exactly what we want.
And if you do not let us continue with our work, I will hold a press conference here, right now, right in this road, and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era."
Then he was kind of troubled, and asked me for a compromise.
But I told him no, I'm sorry, compromise in colors is gray, and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.
So it's time for change.
The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost.
The pride of people about their own place of living, and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal, barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.
And when colors came out everywhere, a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.
Big noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening?
What are colors doing to us?"
And we made a poll, the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.
We asked people, "Do you want this action, and to have buildings painted like that?"
And then the second question was, "Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
But to the second question, half of them that didn't like it, they wanted it to continue.
So we noticed change.
People started to drop less litter in the streets, for example, started to pay taxes, started to feel something they had forgotten, and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.
One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored, and where we were in the process of planting trees, when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop.
They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place.
"Why did you throw away the shutters?" I asked him.
"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered.
"Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?"
"Come on, man! What policemen?
You can see it for yourself. There are colors, streetlights, new pavement with no potholes, trees. So it's beautiful; it's safe."
And indeed, it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected.
And this was not a misplaced feeling.
Crime did fall.
The freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city, while the barbarism of the '90s brought about a loss of hope for the city.
The paint on the walls did not feed children, nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant, but it gave hope and light, and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things, a different spirit, a different feel to our lives, and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics, we could build a better life for each other and for our country.
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks.
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city, up to eight stories high, the tallest of them.
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
We established a green tax, and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly.
By means of open competitions, we managed to recruit in our administration many young people, and we thus managed to build a de-politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented.
International organizations have invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years, not all of it well spent.
When I told the World Bank directors that I wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption, they did not understand me.
But people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.
They were paying in order to skip the queue, the long queue.
The reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole, and, on the other hand, a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe.
We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks, every week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.
"I'm convinced," I told a German official with the World Bank, "that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in Germany, in a German administration, just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes, they would be bribed just the same."
It's not about genes.
It's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience.
It's about system, it's about organization.
It's also about environment and respect.
We removed the kiosks.
We built the bright new reception hall that made people, Tirana citizens, think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests.
We created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes.
We put the citizen first, and not the clerks.
The corruption in the state administration of countries like Albania -- it's not up to me to say also like Greece -- can be fought only by modernization.
Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer, and not reinventing people based on a ready-made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us.
Things have come to this point because politicians in general, but especially in our countries, let's face it, think people are stupid.
They take it for granted that, come what may, people have to follow them, while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people.
Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians, while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation.
Seen from those stairs, all politicians today seem the same, and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism.
Barack Obama won — — because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks.
He did not know each and every one of them, but with an admirable ingenuity, he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign.
I tweet. I love it.
I love it because it lets me get the message out, but it also lets people get their messages to me.
This is politics, not from top down, but from the bottom up, and sideways, and allowing everybody's voice to be heard is exactly what we need.
Politics is not just about leaders.
It's not just about politicians and laws.
It is about how people think, how they view the world around them, how they use their time and their energy.
When people say all politicians are the same, ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush, if François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.
They are not. They are human beings with different views and different visions for the world.
When people say nothing can change, just stop and think what the world was like 10, 20, 50, 100 years ago.
Our world is defined by the pace of change.
We can all change the world.
I gave you a very small example of how one thing, the use of color, can make change happen.
I want to make more change as Prime Minister of my country, but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to.
President Roosevelt, he said, "Believe you can, and you are halfway there."
Efharisto and kalinihta.

<title>Anupam Mishra: The ancient ingenuity of water harvesting</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With wisdom and wit, Anupam Mishra talks about the amazing feats of engineering built centuries ago by the people of India's Golden Desert to harvest water. These ancient aqueducts and stepwells are still used today -- and are often superior to modern water megaprojects.</description>
For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement: please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain.
So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.
It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall.
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 [centimeters].
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages.
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps -- they are of no use in this area.
So, welcome to the Golden Desert.
Clouds seldom visit this area.
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.
This is a new work, it's a new program.
But for the desert society this is no program; this is their life.
And they harvest rain in many ways.
So, this is the first device they use in harvesting rain.
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].
And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment.
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.
And this is all big raised platform.
You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope.
Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly.
And the water will go where it should go.
And then it is 40 feet deep.
The waterproofing is done perfectly, better than our city contractors, because not a single drop should go waste in this.
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.
And this is pure drinking water.
Below the surface there is hard saline water.
But now you can have this for year round.
It's two houses.
We often use a term called bylaws.
Because we are used to get written things.
But here it is unwritten by law.
And people made their house, and the water storage tanks.
These raised up platforms just like this stage.
In fact they go 15 feet deep, and collect rain water from roof, there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.
Another big one, this is of course out of the hardcore desert area.
This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.
The age is 400 years.
So, since 400 years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season.
You can calculate the price of that water.
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
It can break sometimes.
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water, it is maintained for so many generations.
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.
But they can be opened for TED people.
And we request them.
You can see person coming up with two canisters of water.
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this.
It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water.
And this is what they call Zero B type of water, because it comes from the clouds, pure distilled water.
We stop for a quick commercial break, and then we come back to the traditional systems.
The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas.
That's why I said that this is a commercial break.
But we will come back, once again, to the traditional thing.
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this.
In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything.
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching, I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area, you will notice in Bikaner things like this: where the water hyacinth couldn't grow, the sand is flowing in these canals.
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.
We had full-page advertisements, some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.
They said that throw away your traditional systems, these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.
It's a dream. And it became a dream also.
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.
And people started renovating their own structures.
These are all traditional water structures, which we won't be able to explain in such a short time.
But you can see that no woman is standing on those.
And they are plaiting hair.
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.
This town was established 800 years ago.
I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there, or Delhi was there, or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.
So, this was the terminal point for silk route.
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.
None of us were able to go to Europe, but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.
And this is the 16 centimeter area.
Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.
You won't find water in this slide.
But it is invisible.
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here.
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms.
But apart from this system, they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.
And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also.
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body.
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.
Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout.
Another water body, dried up, of course, during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.
These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table.
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today "mass communication."
This was for mass communication.
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned, so water will be there for seven months or nine months, or 12 months.
And then they will come and worship this pond, pay respect, their gratitude.
Another small water body, called the [unclear].
It is difficult to translate in English, especially in my English.
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up.
In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session, so they painted it like this.
Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain.
This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.
But this is not ground water.
You can draw ground water from any well.
But this is no ordinary well.
It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand.
And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].
And there is a gypsum belt running below it.
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth, some three million years ago.
And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water.
This is the same dry water body.
Now, you don't find any kund; they are all submerged.
But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year.
This year they have received only six centimeters.
Six centimeter of rainfall, and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city, Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.
How they maintain them?
There are three things: concept, planning, making the actual thing, and also maintaining them.
It is a structure for maintain, for centuries, by generations, without any department, without any funding, So the secret is "[unclear]," respect.
Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time.
So, these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected.
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.
If you climb these three, six steps you will find something very nice.
This was done in 11th century.
And you have to go further down.
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we can say a thousand words right now, an another thousand words.
If the water table goes down, you will find new stairs.
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
So, throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.
Excuse me, who built these structures?
They are in front of you.
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners, the best architects.
We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847.
There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.
But such people, compelled to the East India Company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...
but not to create the engineering colleges.
But because of them, first engineering college was created in a small village, not in the town.
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert.
So, you can find through your Jeep, a camel, and a cart.
This tire comes from the airplane.
So, look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater, and also create something through a tire from a jet plane, and used in a camel cart.
Last picture, it's a tattoo, 2,000-years-old tattoo.
They were using it on their body.
Tattoo was, at one time, a kind of a blacklisted or con thing, but now it is in thing.
You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.
The center of life is water.
These are the beautiful waves.
These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides.
These are the trees.
And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives.
So, this is the message of desert.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere, that the world can learn from this?
Or is this just right for this place?
Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area.
So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere, right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.
And these [unclear], which stored water, there are two type of things.
One recharge, and one stores.
So, it depends on the terrain.
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt, for that you have to go back to your calendar, three million years ago.
If it is there it can be done right now.
Otherwise, it can't be done.
CA: Thank you so much.

<title>Dan Meyer: Math class needs a makeover</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Today's math curriculum is teaching students to expect -- and excel at -- paint-by-numbers classwork, robbing kids of a skill more important than solving problems: formulating them. Dan Meyer shows classroom-tested math exercises that prompt students to stop and think.</description>
Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something -- a movie, an album, a song or a book -- and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked, and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it, and it came back, and the person hated it?
So, by way of introduction, that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years.
I teach high school math.
I sell a product to a market that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see, a useful stereotype about you all.
I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam, and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate.
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today.
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
For example, factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one.
This stuff is also really easy to relearn, provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning -- we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach.
This is what we would love students to retain, even if they don't go into mathematical fields.
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won't retain it.
So, I'd like to talk about why that is, why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it and, to close with, why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher.
So first, five symptoms that you're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom.
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.
Students lack perseverance.
They lack retention; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.
There's an aversion to word problems, which describes 99 percent of my students.
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation.
This is really destructive.
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows, has a really good description for this.
He swore off creating contemporary drama, shows set in the present day, because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect, it shapes the neural pathways, he said, in such a way that they expect simple problems.
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes, three commercial breaks and a laugh track.
And I'll put it to all of you, what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.
I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.
I'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way.
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning and patient problem solving, it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.
It applies equally to math.
Notice, first of all here, that you have exactly three pieces of information there, each of which will figure into a formula somewhere, eventually, which the student will then compute.
I believe in real life.
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance; where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out, or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some.
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.
When it comes time to do the actual problem set, we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from, it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.
You could literally, I mean this, pass this particular unit without knowing any physics, just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.
It's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift.
But what you have here is actually four separate layers, and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and, particularly, how when they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once, how that creates this impatient problem solving.
I'll define them here: You have the visual.
You also have the mathematical structure, talking about grids, measurements, labels, points, axes, that sort of thing.
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about: which section is the steepest.
So I hope you can see.
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer, but we're paving a smooth, straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way.
That's all we're doing here.
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students, we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.
So right here I start with the visual, and I immediately ask the question: Which section is the steepest?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.
So you get people arguing against each other, friend versus friend, in pairs, journaling, whatever.
And then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line.
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A, B, C and D labels to talk about them more easily.
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean, we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.
And then and only then, we throw down that mathematical structure.
The math serves the conversation, the conversation doesn't serve the math.
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.
But if you need to, your students can then develop those substeps together.
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein, who, I believe, has paid his dues.
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important, and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here, we just give problems to students; we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.
And here's how it works.
I like this question. It's about a water tank.
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.
Students have to develop those, they have to formulate those.
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.
Students need to decide, "All right, well, does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
So now we have a water tank.
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms, not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks, we go out and we take a picture of it.
So now we have the real deal.
How long will it take it to fill it up?
And then even better is we take a video, a video of someone filling it up.
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.
It's tedious.
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes, and they're all wondering at some point or another, "Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me because, like the intro, I teach kids -- because of my inexperience -- I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me, so I won't talk about it.
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.
Everyone's filled something up with water before, so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation.
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses, and kids have bought in here.
And then we follow the process I've described.
And the best part here, or one of the better parts is that we don't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher's edition.
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.
And that's terrifying, because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition, that's great, but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.
But those conversations have been so valuable, among the most valuable.
So I'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class.
These are the kids who now, one semester in, I can put something on the board, totally new, totally foreign, and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year, which is just so fun.
We're no longer averse to word problems, because we've redefined what a word problem is.
We're no longer intimidated by math, because we're slowly redefining what math is.
This has been a lot of fun.
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia, because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation; to let students build the problem, because Einstein said so; and to finally, in total, just be less helpful, because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways: It's buying you out of your obligation, for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap, and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better," which, wow.
I put this problem on my blog recently: In a grocery store, which line do you get into, the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom, but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later, which is just bizarre, right?
And from all of this, I can only conclude that people, not just students, are really hungry for this.
Math makes sense of the world.
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition.
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education -- whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever -- insist on better math curriculum.
We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you.

<title>Mariana Mazzucato: Government -- investor, risk-taker, innovator</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why doesn’t the government just get out of the way and let the private sector -- the “real revolutionaries” -- innovate? It’s rhetoric you hear everywhere, and Mariana Mazzucato wants to dispel it. In an energetic talk, she shows how the state -- which many see as a slow, hunkering behemoth -- is really one of our most exciting risk-takers and market-shapers.</description>
Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies, the really cool companies, the innovative ones, the creative, new economy-type companies -- Apple, Google, Facebook -- are coming out of one particular country, the United States of America?
Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!
That's Europe." But, yeah.
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.
Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles?
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model, which they understand is different from this old economy growth model?
And what is interesting is that often, even if we're in the 21st century, we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state.
It's talked about in these modern ways, but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley, the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms, the private initiative, whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies, the gazelles as we often call them, which traditional banks are scared of, or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions, their products, to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail.
But what really interests me, especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world, is the language that's used, the narrative, the discourse, the images, the actual words.
So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box.
They are more dynamic.
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford, where he said to be innovative, you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.
Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys, right?
And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector.
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could.
And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan. Right?
This monster with big tentacles.
They're very explicit in these editorials.
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?
Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.
Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what?
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."
They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth.
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers.
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion that we have on where, when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which, of course, as we know, are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition.
Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.
So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy.
And so to think again, there's no reason that you should believe me, so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.
Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone.
What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?
So the Internet, which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world; GPS, where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world; the touchscreen display, which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded.
And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.
The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.
Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot," but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department.
So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth, is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits, because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.
So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs -- Viagra, different color, different dosage -- are the less revolutionary ones.
And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.
They do. They spend on the marketing part.
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock, which is quite problematic.
In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R&amp;D, but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about.
Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.
It was actually shaping and creating markets.
It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research.
It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.
So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important.
Why? Because, as many of us know, V.C. is actually quite short-term.
They want their returns in three to five years.
Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years.
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?
Of course, it's not just the state.
The private sector does a lot.
But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box.
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state.
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology, came from within government.
And so there's huge implications of this.
First of all, of course I'm not someone, this old-fashioned person, market versus state.
What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.
But the point is, by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan, I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way.
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part, the public part -- well, they're both P's -- with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking.
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking.
It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way.
So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations.
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri, actually thought really hard about this, how to welcome failure, because you will fail.
You will fail when you innovative.
One out of 10 experiments has any success.
And the V.C. guys know this, and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success.
And this brings me, actually, probably, to the biggest implication, and this has huge implications beyond innovation.
If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward?
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course, the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship, and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait, to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds, that whole risk-reward thing.
Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?
The Internet was crazy.
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.
You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were.
Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.
And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.
You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.
Well, unfortunately, that's not true.
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.
Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.
I mean, one can take a position on that.
But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- Apple's a great example.
They even got the first -- well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.
And yet we know they legally, as many other companies, pay very little tax back.
So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not?
It could happen perhaps through equity.
This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments.
Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money, it's a public funding agency in Finland, which then funded the next round of Nokias.
The Brazilian Development Bank, which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology, they just announced a $56 billion program for the future on this, is retaining equity in these investments.
So to put it provocatively, had the U.S. government thought about this, and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund, you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund, there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology.
Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained.
But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent.
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right?
Who are the different players in creating value in the economy, and is the state's role, has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?
If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth, because they have not.
Thank you.

<title>Jennifer 8. Lee: The hunt for General Tso</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Reporter Jennifer 8. Lee talks about her hunt for the origins of familiar Chinese-American dishes -- exploring the hidden spots where these two cultures have combined to form a new cuisine.</description>
There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined -- 40,000, actually.
Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history, as a matter of fact.
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington, D.C., which unfortunately is closed now, and about to be turned into Walgreen's.
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll, on H Street in Washington.
And it's not completely gratuitous, because wok and roll -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out.
And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space.
NASA, for example, serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.
So, let me present the question to you: If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie, you should ask yourself, how often do you eat apple pie, versus how often do you eat Chinese food. Right?
And if you think about it, a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese, for example: beef with broccoli, egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken, fortune cookies, chop suey, the take-out boxes.
For example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China, gave them to Chinese to see how they would react.
What is this?
Should I try it?
Try it!
What is it called?
Fortune cookie.
There's a piece of paper inside!
What is this?
You've won a prize!
What is this?
It's a fortune!
Tasty!
So, where are they from?
The short answer is, actually, they're from Japan.
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still small family-run bakeries that make fortune cookies, as they did over 100 years ago, 30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States.
If you see them side by side, there's yellow and brown.
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste, so they're not as sweet as our version.
So, how did they get to the United States?
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over, and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles, and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo-do, which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan.
They back then, actually, made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto.
So, the interesting question is, how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese?
Well, the short answer is, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II, including those that made fortune cookies, so that's the time when the Chinese moved in, kind of saw a market opportunity and took over.
So, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese, but ultimately consumed by Americans.
They are more American than anything else.
Another one of my favorite dishes: General Tso's Chicken -- which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.
I love this dish.
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso, and he has marched very far indeed, because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love.
He has marched so far, actually, that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.
He's in Taiwan right now.
He's retired, deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong.
So, he -- after this I showed him, he got up, and he's like, "Mominqimiao," which means, "This is all nonsense," and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon.
So, another dish. One of my favorites. Beef with broccoli.
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable; in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s, but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
In fact, the Chinese had their own version of broccoli, which is called Chinese broccoli, but right now, what -- they've now discovered American broccoli, and are importing it as a, sort of, exotic delicacy.
I guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life -- and indeed, that actually was a picture of General Tso.
I went to his home town.
This is a billboard that says: "Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."
And I went looking for chicken.
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken.
Believe it or not, these guys were actually crossing the road.
And -- -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town.
This guy is now five generations removed from the General; this guy is about seven.
Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you, and they're like, we don't know this dish.
And then they're like, is this Chinese food?
Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.
But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them, because in their eyes he is, after all, a famous Qing dynasty military hero.
He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion, which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ.
And caused the war that killed 20 million people -- still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day.
So, you know, I realized when I was there, General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America, in that he's known for chicken and not war.
But in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken.
But the granddaddy of all the Chinese-American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey, which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century.
And according to New York Times, in 1904, there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town, and "the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that, whoa, chop suey is actually not known in China.
And as this article points out, "The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey."
You know, back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan: if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl, you could take her out on a chop suey date.
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another, because chop suey, if you translate into Chinese, means tsap sui, which, if you translate back, means "odds and ends."
So, these people are going around China asking for chop suey, which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying, I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called "leftovers," and it is particularly -- -- right?
And not only that: this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving.
So, why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from?
Let's go back to mid-1800s when the Chinese first came to America.
Now back then, the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.
In fact, they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien.
These people weren't eating dogs -- they were eating cats -- and they weren't eating cats -- they were eating rats.
In fact, The New York Times, my esteemed employer, in 1883 ran an article that asked, "Do Chinese eat rats?"
And not the most PC question to be asked today, but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time, not so outlandish.
This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s, and if you see, under the word "Clears" -- very small -- it says, "They must go," which refers not only to the rats, but to the Chinese in their midst, because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us.
And another way that you saw, sort of, this sort of, this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this.
This is actually in the Library of Congress; it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers, hero of our American labor movement, and it's called, "Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion: Meat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism: Which shall survive?
And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat.
this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So, with sentiments like these, the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902, the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity.
So, in a way, because the Chinese were attacked, chop suey was created as a defense mechanism.
Now, who came up with the idea of chop suey?
There's a lot of different mysteries, a lot of different legends, but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from 1904.
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says, I want you guys all to stop making chop suey, because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey.
And the way that he tells it, there was a guy, there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up, and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.
And as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically, the American man has become very rich.
Lem Sen, who's this guy: I would have made this money, too, but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe.
Now I've come and found him, and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey, or pay me for the right to do the same.
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.
So the thing is, this kind of idea of Chinese-American food doesn't exist only in America.
In fact, if you think about it, Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet, served on all seven continents, even Antarctica, because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station, which is the main scientific station in Antarctica.
So, you see different varieties of Chinese food.
For example, there is French Chinese food, where they serve salt and pepper frog legs.
There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies, so they serve fried gelato.
My downstairs neighbor, Alessandra, was completely shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
She's like, "It's not?
But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."
And even the Brits have their own version.
This is a dish called crispy shredded beef, which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred, and not a lot of beef.
There is West Indian Chinese food, there's Jamaican Chinese food, there is Middle Eastern Chinese food, there's Mauritian Chinese food.
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered.
There's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food, Japanese Chinese food, where they take the bao, the little buns, and they make them into pizza versions, and they take -- and they -- like, totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes, and they'll just Ramen-ize them.
This is, like, this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup.
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food, which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food, where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas.
And then -- one thing: they have things like risotto chop suey.
My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food."
So, let's take a step back, and kind of, understand what is to be appreciated in America.
McDonald's has, sort of, garnered a lot of attention, a lot of respect, for basically standardizing the menu, décor and dining experience in post-World War II America.
But you know what?
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois, right?
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue, with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters.
So, this actually became very clear to me with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing, where, you know, they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had, to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers.
Instead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked.
They looked all across the country, and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud, because it happened, you know, in different states, across different computer systems.
So whatever it was, it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way.
So, like, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know, like, it was a diamond, or, you know, diagonal.
It wasn't that.
It wasn't that, so they're like, OK, let's look at television, so they looked at an episode of "Lost."
Now, I don't have a TV, which makes me a freak, but very productive, and -- -- and this episode of "Lost," I understand, where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number, which was how long they'd been on the island, but they looked, and the numbers did not match.
So they looked at "The Young and The Restless," and it wasn't that, either.
So, it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day, and they ask him, "Where did you get your number from?"
He's like, "Oh, I got it from a fortune cookie."
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had, because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like, oh, no -- like, this can't be true.
But it was true, and basically, of those 110 people, and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie.
Yeah. So, I went and started looking.
I went across the country, looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from.
You know, there are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha -- which is actually run by Koreans, but that's another point -- and a bunch of them named China Buffet.
So, what's interesting is that their stories were similar, but they were different.
It was lunch, it was take-out, it was sit-down, it was buffet, it was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.
But at some point, all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant, and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies, which, of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with.
So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self-organization, right, where, like in ant colonies, where little decisions made by -- on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level.
So, a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
McDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.
They did chicken pot pie, they did fried chicken, and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them, because that's kind of an easy concept, but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner, which is why it took so long for other people to copy them.
It took 10 years, and then within a couple of months, it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country.
In contrast, we have General Tso's Chicken, which actually started in New York City in the early 1970s, as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early 1970s, so ...
And this logo!
So me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related.
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City.
Someone's like, oh, God -- it's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken: Americans will love this.
So, what I like to say, you know, this being sort of Bay Area, Silicon Valley -- is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences.
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux: sort of an open source thing, right, where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system, that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food, you know, depending on the region.
For example, you know, in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food, where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish, right?
And in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll, which looks like an egg roll on the outside, but a cheesesteak on the inside.
I was really surprised to discover that, not only in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta, because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to -- sorry, from Philadelphia to Atlanta, and brought that with them.
So, the thing is, our historical lore, because of the way we like narratives, are full of vast characters such as, you know, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca-Cola.
But, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example, like Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey, Chef Peng, who introduced General Tso Chicken, and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies.
So, the point of my presentation is to make you think twice, that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much, if not more, impact on what we eat today.
So. Thank you very much.

<title>Juan Enriquez: Using biology to rethink the energy challenge</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Juan Enriquez challenges our definition of bioenergy. Oil, coal, gas and other hydrocarbons are not chemical but biological products, based on plant matter -- and thus, growable. Our whole approach to fuel, he argues, needs to change.</description>
What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.
Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building that bridge to the future, to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do that, you really have to look first at agriculture.
So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests, you've got to deal with all types of awful things, you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.
You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation makes a difference.
Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the rivers flood. You start getting this organic agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water, leads to very large-scale agriculture.
You put together machines and water, and you get landscapes that look like this. And then you get sales that look like this. It's brute force. So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system. You start taming that natural system. You put a lot of force behind that natural system. You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system, and you end up with systems that look like this.
And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've been approaching energy. So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology. And you move from a discipline of engineering, you move from a discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of biology. And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.
This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of people have criticized. But of course, those are people who don't realize that China and India, instead of having huge amounts of starving people, are exporting grains.
And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research, which was Mexico, didn't adopt this technology, ignored this technology, talked about why this technology should be thought about, but not really applied.
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico. There are in China and India. And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India. That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies.
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world. It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does, if you understand biology.
What happened in agriculture? Well, if you take agriculture over a century, agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look different. The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules, but the farmer would have understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's where you get your productivity increases. And as you do that stuff, here's what happens to productivity.
Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100 bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000, whereas the rest of the economy increased about 2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person.
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced.
This would be a good outcome for energy. And of course, by now, you're probably saying to yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology."
So where's the link between these two things?
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean, literally, it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption, and one of the best guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes out of this stuff, that these things absorb sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of years, and you get these black rivers.
Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- if that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil, and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be concentrated sunlight. And if you think of bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas, concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why you get these rainbows.
And as you're looking at this system, if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels.
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas, the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots.
This is how you farm oil. And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started with this brute force approach. And then what did we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even bigger. And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy.
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it, which only works at today's oil prices.
Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants, except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure.
So you take something like this, you burn it, you put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.
And of course, coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines, you get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines, but not in others.
Any place you see a differential, there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying exactly the same technology.
Here's your brute force approach. Once you get through your brute force approach, then you just rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions, which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably not the best use of bioenergy.
As you think of what are the alternatives to this system -- it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there, and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy, because if we keep treating them as chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're going to be in deep doo-doo.
Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas, well, you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal.
This is called coal bed methane. Why is this picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up -- may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.
This is a well-known phenomenon. You eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true, then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture.
That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture, from brute force into biological force. And in the measure that you can do that, you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it pretty quickly.
We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades, you can get a really substantial increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your output. This is just the beginning stages of this stuff.
And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who did part of the sequencing of the human genome, who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world -- has been thinking about how you structure this. And there's a series of smart people thinking about this. And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like, a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are trying to do is to think of, how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force?
Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.
Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the genes as a software. And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable, that can become energy, that can become food, that can become fiber, that can become human beings, that can become a whole series of things, then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way.
What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading? This is one of the gentle giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.
He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such a modest guy that the day he won, his mother called him and said, "I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just won the Nobel?" I mean, that was Mom, but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find him at the bench every single day, working on a pipette and building stuff. And one of the things this guy just built are these things.
What is this? This is the first transplant of naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell, insert it into a different cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate species. That's one month old. You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff.
And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff, both in economic terms and in energy terms.
This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14 bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the scale on these things is pretty large.
Now, if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind, to the point where you can get to solar, to the point where you can get to nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault. Just a thought.
But in the meantime, for the next decade at least, the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're dealing with. And before I make this talk too long, here's what's happening in the current energy system.
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a role in here for conservation. There's a role in here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to get that other portion right.
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future. And as we think of this bridge to the future, one of the things you should ponder is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there. Which, of course, requires more energy to go out and get energy. The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and the energy output. That is a stupid way of managing this system.
Last point, last graph. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This is what oil prices look like, OK?
This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for wind, or for something else, and then guess what?
The oil price goes through the floor. That company goes out of business, and then you can bring the oil price back up.
So if I had one closing and modest suggestion, let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it basically says for the next 20 years, the price of oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40 bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax goes away.
What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it do for companies? It tells people, if you can produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a business. But let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening. Thank you.

<title>Louise Leakey: A dig for humanity's origins</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Louise Leakey asks, "Who are we?" The question takes her to the Rift Valley in Eastern Africa, where she digs for the evolutionary origins of humankind -- and suggests a stunning new vision of our competing ancestors.</description>
Who are we?
That is the big question.
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape.
This could be us.
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.
We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today.
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times.
We're one species out of approximately, or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years.
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.
And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.
It's important to remember that we evolved.
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.
We have a common past, and we have a common future.
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today.
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.
And this is how we look for them.
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.
I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past.
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
When we find a fossil, we mark it.
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it.
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors.
And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother.
Not many people can say that.
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi.
And the Rift Valley is a depression.
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.
If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried.
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface.
And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you.
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya.
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there.
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin, which represents some 20,000 square miles.
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region.
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there.
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.
In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.
Where did these things come from?
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana.
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains.
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.
And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.
But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died.
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller, members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out.
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved.
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.
Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment.
And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.
It was truly exciting.
He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human.
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe.
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.
But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.
But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about.
Just to put this in terms of generations, because people do find it hard to think of time, Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.
We evolved essentially from an African stock.
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet Earth.
The question now is, well, who are we?
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?
And what is it that really makes us us?
I think it's our collective intelligence.
It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness.
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.
And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places.
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing.
As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us, we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet.
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time.
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.
But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today.
But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species.
My father so appropriately put it, that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species."
Can we hold it together?
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.
We all have an African origin.
We have a common past and we share a common future.
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today.
We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?
Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

<title>Dong Woo Jang: The art of bow-making</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Dong Woo Jang has an unusual after school hobby. Jang, who was 15 when he gave the talk, tells the story of how living in the concrete jungle of Seoul inspired him to build the perfect bow. Watch him demo one of his beautiful hand-crafted archer's bows.</description>
It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and I believe this is true, especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success.
Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment.
While many people responded in different ways about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building.
Why bows?
I'm not quite sure.
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows.
If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times.
The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted mulberry trees.
The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.
The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures.
As I fell deeper into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.
When I went on school field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.
And they would be somethings like saws, knives, sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel.
I would bring the branches home, riding buses and subways, barely holding them in my hands.
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.
Airport security.
In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust, I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape.
One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire.
Where? The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where 96 families call home.
A customer from a department store across from my building called 911, and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned.
I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom, in the audience today: Mom, I was really sorry, and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.
My mother had to do a lot of explaining, telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson.
I also researched extensively on bows around the world.
In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow.
I also worked with many different types of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before.
The most effective bow for me would be like this.
One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow.
Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power.
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage.
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.
After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like this.
I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own.
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them.
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention.
Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage.
Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me.
You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near.
From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before.
In the end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it.
Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.
And let's see how this one works.
This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights.
A bow may function in a simple mechanism, but in order to make a good bow, a great amount of sensitivity is required.
You need to console and communicate with the wood material.
Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow.
I may be an [odd] student with unconventional interests, but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you.
My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind, where everyone is needed exactly where they are, like the fibers and the tendons in a bow, a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient.
The bow resembles me, and I resemble the bow.
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.
No, better yet, a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind.
Did it strike you?
Thank you.

<title>Erin McKean: The joy of lexicography</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Is the beloved paper dictionary doomed to extinction? In this infectiously exuberant talk, leading lexicographer Erin McKean looks at the many ways today's print dictionary is poised for transformation.</description>
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
You know, in a dictionary? Yeah, that's what I thought.
How about this word?
Here, I'll show it to you.
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite, out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
It's little discrete -- that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.
And those bits are words.
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer -- besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words, like lexicographical.
Lexicographical has this great pattern: it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl, I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red.
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
Right? It's a fun word to say, and I get to say it a lot.
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary, and keep the bad words out.
But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun, you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
Well, I blame the Queen.
Why do I blame the Queen?
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
But secondly, I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed.
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965.
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today.
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat, is the face of modernity, you have a problem.
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
There'd be virtually no learning curve.
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
Computers! What about computers?
The thing about computers is, I love computers.
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
They don't change the end result.
Because what a dictionary is, is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
The design has not changed.
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
Online dictionaries must be different.
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
This is my favorite word, by the way.
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
Very useful word. So, look at that.
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
Right? Those little buttons, I had them all expanded except for the date chart.
So there's not very much going on here.
There's not a lot of clickiness.
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
And when you improve searchability, you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for, because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
So -- -- now, when you think about this, what we have here is a ham butt problem.
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away, and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like, "This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
So she calls up mom, and she says, "Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
So they call grandma, and grandma says, "My pan was too small!"
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
We have a pan that's too small!
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, "This map sucks!"
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook, they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think, "This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
The English language is as big as it is.
So, if you have a ham butt problem, and you're thinking about the ham butt problem, the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive: paper is the enemy of words.
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
Some of my best friends are books.
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint, artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go, "Aww." Right?
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals, and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna, and not very much about much else.
And I think this is a problem.
I think we should study all the words, because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts.
Lexicography is really more about material science.
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression: your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me, "Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts, how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"
They're just the right tools for the job.
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real.
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
If you love a word, it becomes real.
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful.
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused. Right?
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic, but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
You can ask for help!
If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.
Library of Congress: 17 million books, of which half are in English.
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it, that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like "un-dictionaried," for example -- in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759, 58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it, it would be an entire other OED.
That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time.
There's a lot going on there.
And I'm not even talking about polysemy, which is the greedy habit some words have of taking So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow, a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff, and there's one numbered definition in the OED.
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."
Do you know what that says to me?
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub.
That's a lexicographical cop out, to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
So, we have all these words, and we really need help!
And the thing is, we could ask for help -- asking for help's not that hard.
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers, and this is more of a visual explanation.
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language, these bright spots are what we know about, and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
And we don't even know the shape of the language.
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida, but there's no California!
We're missing California from American English.
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.
But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
It can't be that hard to find some words!
So, enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings.
And then, ornithologists can go and help track populations, migrations, etc.
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
He's a director of an electroplating company.
He's found more than 140 comets.
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite, and that's how he found them.
If we can find comets without a telescope, shouldn't we be able to find words?
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
And the Internet is great for collecting words, because the Internet's full of collectors.
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet, but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now, but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
Where did it come from? Who said it?
What newspaper was it in? What book?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact, it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
It dies too fast.
So, this whole time I've been saying, "The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
They use it synecdochically.
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically" is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language, or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country -- then you're using it synecdochically.
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
We can put in all the meanings.
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language.
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son, who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
This is what dictionaries used to look like.
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
It wasn't really what people needed.
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words, no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad, we can really describe the language like scientists.
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing, and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

<title>Angela Belcher: Using nature to grow batteries</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Inspired by an abalone shell, Angela Belcher programs viruses to make elegant nanoscale structures that humans can use. Selecting for high-performing genes through directed evolution, she's produced viruses that can construct powerful new batteries, clean hydrogen fuels and record-breaking solar cells. In her talk, she shows us how it's done.</description>
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.
I brought along with me an abalone shell.
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein.
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells, like chalk.
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials, and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job.
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nanoscale.
They're formed at the nanoscale, and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures.
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures, like batteries and like solar cells?
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did, in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure, using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment?
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about.
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?
Or, what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so in an environmentally friendly way?
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nano-structured, one thing that's fascinating, is when a male and a female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material.
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure, using non-toxic materials."
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here, which are glasseous structures.
Every time the diatoms replicate, they give the genetic information that says, "Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano-structured.
And you can do it the same, over and over again."
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old.
But anyone who's ever had, or knows, small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms.
And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do, it's very difficult.
So when we think about future technologies, we actually think of using bacteria and virus, simple organisms.
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me?
Also, when we think about future technologies, we start with the beginning of Earth.
Basically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth.
And very rapidly, they became multi-cellular, they could replicate, they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source.
But it wasn't until about 500 million years ago -- during the Cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials.
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials.
And so that's what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.
Now if you look at biology, there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano-structured.
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale.
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?
So here are some examples: these are some natural shells.
There are natural biological materials.
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured.
There's diatoms made out of SIO2, and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation.
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale, and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures.
Now, going back to the abalone shell, the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.
These proteins are very negatively charged.
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids, which says, "This is how to build the structure.
Here's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence in order to do it."
And so an interesting idea is, what if you could take any material that you wanted, or any element on the periodic table, and find its corresponding DNA sequence, then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure, but not build an abalone shell -- build something that, through nature, it has never had the opportunity to work with yet.
And so here's the periodic table.
And I absolutely love the periodic table.
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT, I have a periodic table made that says, "Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element."
And you flip it over, and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges.
And so I give this out to thousands of people.
And I know it says MIT, and this is Caltech, but I have a couple extra if people want it.
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT, and I really wanted to give him a periodic table.
So I stayed up at night, and I talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table?
What if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,' or, 'I've already memorized it'?"
And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit.
And then afterward, I said, "Sir, I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight."
And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass.
And so he looked at it, and he said, "Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy, he pulled it out and said, "And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables."
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about 500 million years ago, organisms starter making materials, but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it.
It took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student.
"I have this great project -- 50 million years."
And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.
And so we use a virus that's a non-toxic virus called M13 bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria.
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it.
And by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences.
And this is pretty easy biotechnology.
And you could basically do this a billion times.
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical, but they differ from each other based on their tips, on one sequence that codes for one protein.
Now if you take all billion viruses, and you can put them in one drop of liquid, you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table.
And through a process of selection evolution, you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do, like grow a battery or grow a solar cell.
So basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.
Once you find that one out of a billion, you infect it into a bacteria, and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence.
And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales.
And these viruses are long and skinny, and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries.
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube.
The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery.
And then it wires itself to the current collector.
And so through a process of selection evolution, we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature, basically at the bench top.
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference.
I brought it here.
You can see it in this case -- that's lighting this LED.
Now if we could scale this, you could actually use it to run your Prius, which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car.
But it's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion.
You can make lots of amplifications to it.
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab, and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery.
We're able to do this also with catalysis.
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water.
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna, and you get an energy transfer across the virus.
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels.
And I brought an example with me of that today.
My students promised me it would work.
These are virus-assembled nanowires.
When you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.
In this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out.
And basically, by controlling the genes, you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance.
The last example are solar cells.
You can also do this with solar cells.
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device.
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems.
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward.
So this is a virus-based solar cell.
Through evolution and selection, we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.
So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force, or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials, to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making.
Thank you.

<title>Stefan Sagmeister: Happiness by design</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Graphic designer Stefan Sagmeister takes the audience on a whimsical journey through moments of his life that made him happy -- and notes how many of these moments have to do with good design.</description>
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.
And at the time I was very superstitious.
So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city -- I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there.
And it turned out that -- I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
But I actually walked away with a great job offer.
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.
But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it.
On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.
However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life -- of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to as "moments that take your breath away."
And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.
Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you.
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.
What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.
So there are, of course, two different possibilities.
There's one from a consumer's point of view -- where I was happy while experiencing design.
And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.
This is 1983.
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely.
And The Police's "Synchronicity" cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects.
And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know, situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.
Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint -- if you're happy while actually doing it.
And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?
So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy.
While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...
and, I think, particularly, the Swiss , don't seem to be doing all that well.
Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum, in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because -- well, also, with an eye on this conference.
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period -- a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.
Under "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.
This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.
And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know open as much room for the un-representable -- and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.
Then, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings -- also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.
And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.
Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness.
And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization -- that's a really easy thing to do.
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.
This is, you know, a book.
A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.
It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.
You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view.
This is, you know, the movie poster.
Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.
Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness -- and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs?
True printed his own version of these signs.
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.
So this is one.
Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.
So you're you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.
And it takes you a while until it actually -- you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.
I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.
Now, True is a real humanitarian.
He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested, so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody -- sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.
Another New York project.
This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.
You don't see the horizon.
You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.
And the room is truly something to be seen.
People's demeanor changes when they go in there.
And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there.
There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud" a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.
But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.
He's from Korea originally.
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.
And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.
And other people go and fill them in.
This one says, "Please let me die in peace."
I think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
This is on a musician poster, that says: "I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units and that, as a result, my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me, after which, my contract will be cancelled, and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.
Jee gets to have his project; the public gets a sweeter environment; and different public gets a place to express itself; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.
Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while: You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?
Which brought me back to my list making -- you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.
You know, one is: just working without pressure.
Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled.
Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing -- or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.
This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.
Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things where the content is actually important for me.
And being able to enjoy the end results.
And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.
And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?
And the whole thing just fell together.
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned -- in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" -- and we made these spreads right out of this.
So it was: "Everything I do always comes back to me."
A couple of weeks ago, a French company asked us to design five billboards for them.
Again, we could supply the content for it.
So I just picked another one.
And this was two weeks ago.
We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself -- and photographed this one.
So it's: "Trying to look good limits my life."
And then we did one more of these.
This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.
This is: "Having" -- this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side.
This is from the front.
Then it's: "guts."
Again, it's the same thing -- "guts" is just the same room, reworked.
Then it's: "always works out."
Then it's "for," with the light on.
And it's "me."
Thank you so much.

<title>Peter Diamandis: Stephen Hawking's zero g flight</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: X Prize founder Peter Diamandis talks about how he helped Stephen Hawking fulfill his dream of going to space -- by flying together into the upper atmosphere and experiencing weightlessness at zero g.</description>
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier.
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.
And I want to tell you that story.
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE, for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
Craig Venter chairs that event.
And I met Professor Hawking, and he said his dream was to travel into space.
And I said, "I can't take you there, but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.
We set out to do this.
It took us 11 years to become operational.
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say, you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.
And he wanted to go.
We worked hard to get all the permissions.
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
We had a press conference, we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola, give him 25 seconds of zero-g.
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center, up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.
We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities -- who flew with us.
A few TEDsters here.
We set up a whole ER.
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
We had everything all set in case of an emergency; God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
We took off from the shuttle landing facility, where the shuttle takes off and lands.
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero-g.
Once he was there, [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like.
And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.
So we did a second parabola.
And a third.
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did.
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.
And a seventh and an eighth.
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.
He was so happy.
We are living on a precious jewel, and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
Please join us in this epic adventure.
Thank you so much.

<title>Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When are humans most happy? To gather data on this question, Matt Killingsworth built an app, Track Your Happiness, that let people report their feelings in real time. Among the surprising results: We're often happiest when we're lost in the moment. And the flip side: The more our mind wanders, the less happy we can be. </description>
So, people want a lot of things out of life, but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end towards which all other things aim.
According to this view, the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.
It's that we expect them to bring us happiness.
Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want. We're richer.
We live longer. We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.
The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically, we haven't actually gotten any happier.
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness, there's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself.
People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years, but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.
In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion in research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot about its demographics, how things like income and education, gender and marriage relate to it.
But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less, or to graduate from college instead of dropping out, but the differences in happiness tend to be small.
Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?
I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet, but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.
It certainly seems that we're going about our lives, that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about, have a big influence on our happiness, and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult, in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org, it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.
How does this work? Basically, I send people signals at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal.
The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day, minute to minute in some cases, and try to understand how what people are doing, who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all the other factors that describe our day, how those might relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness.
We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before, over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people.
And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group, people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s, a wide range of incomes, education levels, people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.
They collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.
What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating, and that's mind-wandering.
As human beings, we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present.
This guy is sitting here working on his computer, and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month, wondering what he's going to have for dinner.
Maybe he's worried that he's going bald.
This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness.
You've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present. "Be here now," you've probably heard a hundred times.
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.
Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing.
On the other hand, when our minds wander, they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.
In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.
There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question: How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad to very good? Second, an activity question: What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV?
And finally a mind-wandering question: Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing?
People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task -- or yes -- I am thinking about something else -- and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant, neutral or unpleasant.
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.
So what did we find?
This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis, and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present, when they're not mind-wandering.
As it turns out, people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not.
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure, on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering, but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.
Nope. As it turns out, people are less happy when they're mind-wandering no matter what they're doing. For example, people don't really like commuting to work very much.
It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else.
It's amazing.
So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason, a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things, and they are enormously less happy when they do that, our worries, our anxieties, our regrets, and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral, they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind-wandering at all.
Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant, they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind-wandering.
If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars or one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play.
So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps, that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.
It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.
Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites?
Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not backward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.
We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person, and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight into the causal direction.
As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later, consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.
In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later.
In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.
A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play.
Well, how often do people's minds wander?
Turns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing.
How does that depend on what people are doing?
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent — — when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth, to 50 percent when they're working, to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at.
Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex.
But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph, and that is, basically with one exception, no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think, that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.
It pervades basically everything that we do.
In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering, a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness.
My hope is that over time, by tracking people's moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness, and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier, but happier as well.
Thank you.

<title>Joshua Silver: Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Josh Silver delivers his brilliantly simple solution for correcting vision at the lowest cost possible -- adjustable, liquid-filled lenses. At TEDGlobal 2009, he demos his affordable eyeglasses and reveals his global plan to distribute them to a billion people in need by 2020.</description>
I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved.
I'd like to start with a little experiment.
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery?
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction.
The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people.
They also have an estimate of around a billion.
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.
There are just way too few eye care professionals.
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K.
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.
How do you do this? How do you solve this problem?
I came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem.
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there.
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.
Next step in my process.
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I've just ...
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.
In fact, this technology's been evolving.
I started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly.
There are about 30,000 in use now.
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
I have a global vision for vision.
And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.
The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down.
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.
But the cost has to be brought right down.
It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day.
How do you solve this problem?
You start to get into detail.
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
How do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?
How do you deal with the industry?
And the answer to that is research.
What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.
If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you.

<title>Janet Iwasa: How animations can help scientists test a hypothesis</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: 3D animation can bring scientific hypotheses to life. Molecular biologist Janet Iwasa introduces a new open-source animation software designed just for scientists.</description>
Take a look at this drawing.
Can you tell what it is?
I'm a molecular biologist by training, and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.
They're usually referred to as a model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs.
This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell.
There's a problem with this drawing, though, and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.
From lots of experiments, from lots of different scientists, we know a lot about what these molecules look like, how they move around in the cell, and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment.
So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen, we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that.
So we start outside of the cell.
Now we're looking inside.
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.
Through connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell.
Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle, making it separate from the rest of the membrane, and now clathrin is basically done with its job, and so proteins are coming in now — we've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage.
And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again.
These processes are too small to be seen directly, even with the best microscopes, so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis.
Here's another illustration, and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.
And again, this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes.
You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses.
Why?
Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard.
I spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software, and I spend months on each animation, and that's just time that most researchers can't afford.
The payoffs can be huge, though.
Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.
And I'm working on a new project now called "The Science of HIV" where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail.
The animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades, data on what this virus looks like, how it's able to infect cells in our body, and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection.
Over the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis.
Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study, and with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore.
The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas.
One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together, and in this way, animation can feed back into the research process.
I believe that animation can change biology.
It can change the way that we communicate with one another, how we explore our data and how we teach our students.
But for that change to happen, we need more researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations.
From our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis.
We're also building an online database where anyone can view, download and contribute their own animations.
We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today.
We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures.
Thank you.

<title>Julia Bacha: Pay attention to nonviolence</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 2003, the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month-long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves. Did you hear about it? Didn't think so. Brazilian filmmaker Julia Bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict -- and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace.</description>
I'm a filmmaker.
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?
Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance?
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers.
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.
Yet, most of you have probably never heard about them.
This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful.
So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention, and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere -- but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus.
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village.
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank.
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
Let me show you some brief clips, so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground.
Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel.
Here in Budrus, we realized the wall would steal our land.
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact, created a solution to terror.
Man: Today you're invited to a peaceful march.
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition.
Woman: We saw the men trying to push the soldiers, but none of them could do that.
But I think the girls could do it.
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds of traditional thinking.
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
Chanting: One united nation.
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
They were allowed to use any force necessary.
Man: These are live bullets.
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear].
Protester: This is a peaceful march.
There is no need to use violence.
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!
We can do it!
Julia Bacha: When I first heard about the story of Budrus, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago, in 2003.
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful.
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories.
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow, or even survive, in Palestine.
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause.
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue, it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight.
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room.
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit.
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior, since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children.
But that's true for adults too.
In fact, the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced, depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention.
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation.
In a village called Wallajeh, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus.
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.
So we organized a screening.
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date.
The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared.
So they kept on going.
On the Israeli side, there is a new peace movement called Solidariot, which means solidarity in Hebrew.
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools.
They report that Israelis who had never been active before, upon seeing the film, understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities.
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in, Ni'lin, Wallajeh, in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible, valued and effective in their work.
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened.
But I have seen first hand that if we do, they will multiply.
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation.
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.
Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.
Thank you.

<title>Rob Hopkins: Transition to a world without oil</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Rob Hopkins reminds us that the oil our world depends on is steadily running out. He proposes a unique solution to this problem -- the Transition response, where we prepare ourselves for life without oil and sacrifice our luxuries to build systems and communities that are completely independent of fossil fuels.</description>
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future, and where we might move forward from this point.
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.
But I want to tell you a different story here today.
Like all stories, it has a beginning.
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education, in teaching people practical skills for sustainability, teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food, how to build buildings using local materials, how to generate their own energy, and so on.
I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland, and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model, and moderating what comes in at one end, and moderating the outputs at the other end.
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly.
And in order to introduce you to that, I've got something here that I'm going to unveil, which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.
And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.
This is a liter of oil.
This bottle of oil, distilled over a hundred million years of geological time, ancient sunlight, contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor -- equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you.
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials, medicine, modern clothing, laptops, a whole range of different things.
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.
We've based the design of our settlements, our business models, our transport plans, even the idea of economic growth, some would argue, on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.
Yet, when we take a step back, and look over the span of history, at what we might call the petroleum interval, it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material, and then based a whole way of life around it.
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage, we move from a time where our economic success, our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume, to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability.
And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever.
For every four barrels of oil that we consume, we only discover one.
And that gap continues to widen.
There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it.
Completely unprecedented, historically.
Already that's fallen to about 11.
And that's why, now, the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta, or at the bottom of the oceans.
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.
The moment when the world on average passes this peak, people wonder when that's going to happen.
And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high.
But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side?
No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are.
There is also the issue of climate change, is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists, is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes, as the data that's coming in, which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.
So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.
Actually, if current trends continue, it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.
But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us.
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain, that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."
And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.
There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."
The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and all the shoes are magically made for them.
It's something that was unimaginable to people then.
Now we have the seven-league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.
We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco.
And we have the elves in the form of China.
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been.
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now, as we look forward about where we're going to go.
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual, that the future will be like the present, just more of it.
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question.
And in terms of climate change, is something that is not actually feasible.
There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse.
This is a popular story in some places.
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything, that technology can somehow get us through this completely.
And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks, the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis, that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints, the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side, the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world.
But the world isn't Second Life.
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.
And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other, there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals to make all of those things.
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances, usually at the expense of the local, more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past, which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.
Energy and technology are not the same thing.
What I'm involved with is the transition response.
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need.
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.
And it is something which has several characteristics.
It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it.
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.
It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do where they are, to respond to this.
It's sensitive to place and to scale.
Transitional is completely different.
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here, what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.
It learns very much from its mistakes.
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary.
And it's a process which is really joyful.
People have a huge amount of fun doing this, reconnecting with other people as they do it.
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.
And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.
And it's really about how systems, settlements, withstand shock from the outside.
When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.
And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.
Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable.
Resilience runs much deeper: it's about building modularity into what we do, building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.
This is at a time when the city of Bristol, which is quite close to here, was surrounded by commercial market gardens, which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.
There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time, which we can now only look back on with envy.
So how does this transition idea work?
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.
They start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town.
They show films, they give talks, and so on.
It's a process which is playful and creative and informative.
Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this, and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable.
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland, where I was teaching, and has since spread.
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea, but what do they actually do on the ground?
Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.
We need national responses. We need local government responses.
But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable, over the next 5 to 10 years.
Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects, like community-supported agriculture schemes, urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies, community-owned energy companies, where the community can invest money into itself, to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.
A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food.
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.
This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on.
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody?
As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world.
We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener.
Which he did -- -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities, Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud, the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.
And the head of the council said, "If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time."
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this.
And we see it all over the place as well now.
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions.
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories.
Because I think stories are vital here.
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company.
And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.
So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?
Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil.
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.
But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point.
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other.
Thank you very much.

<title>Elizabeth Pisani: Sex, drugs and HIV -- let's get rational</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Armed with bracing logic, wit and her "public-health nerd" glasses, Elizabeth Pisani reveals the myriad of inconsistencies in today's political systems that prevent our dollars from effectively fighting the spread of HIV. Her research with at-risk populations -- from junkies in prison to sex workers on the street in Cambodia -- demonstrates the sometimes counter-intuitive measures that could stall the spread of this devastating disease.</description>
"People do stupid things.
That's what spreads HIV."
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper, The Guardian, not that long ago.
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?
Well, one or two brave souls.
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for 15 years, worked on four continents, and you're looking at her.
And I am now going to argue that this is only half true.
People do get HIV because they do stupid things, but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons.
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm in public health, and if you put your public health nerd glasses on, you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them, if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information, and a little bit of motivation, people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives.
Wonderful.
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV, and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality, and if you were at TED '07 it's about coffee prices ...
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction.
So, let's start with what's rational for an addict.
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail, and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues.
And so everyone lined up, all the smackheads in a row, and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit, and he went down and started injecting people.
So he injects the first guy, and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt, and he injects the next guy.
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line, and I can see the needle coming down towards me, and there is blood all over the place.
It's getting blunter and blunter.
And a small part of my brain is thinking, 'That is so gross and really dangerous,' but most of my brain is thinking, 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me.
Please let there be some left.'" And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, "You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid."
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.
But, actually, Frankie, at that time, was a heroin addict and he was in jail.
So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.
And if there's one place you really want to get high, it's when you're in jail.
But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes, so let's look at some data.
We talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia, and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"
"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that?"
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."
"So are you carrying a needle?"
We're actually interviewing people on the street, in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
"Are you carrying clean needles?"
One in four, maximum.
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
So you've got this massive mismatch; everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV, but they're all sharing anyway.
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
There's just kind of an ick factor there.
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
So, in Indonesia at this time, if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up, they could put you into jail.
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?
Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now, or I could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me 10 years from now, or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow.
And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV, they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway.
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles.
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.
This is a really easy problem.
For once, your incentives are aligned.
We've got what's rational for public health.
You want people to use clean needles -- and junkies want to use clean needles.
So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest.
Now, the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher.
And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program, and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV.
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example, Moscow, Jakarta -- we're talking, at its peak, one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease.
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies.
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service.
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention, she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on, and obviously those are much higher.
So she was making a politically rational decision.
Now, if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data, it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?
But in this country, where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens, we've taken a very different approach.
So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States, and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective -- you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up, but no -- that's the whole slide.
There is nothing on the other side.
So, completely irrational, you would think.
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too, and they're responding to what they think the voters want.
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this.
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors.
Now let's talk about sex.
Are we any more rational about sex?
Well, I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church, who think somehow that if you give out condoms, everyone's going to run out and have sex.
I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online, but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict -- I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid.
It's not that easy!
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.
Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually.
So, it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids.
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected, then you start making antibodies, and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
But basically, nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS, and by that stage, you're not looking great, you're not feeling great, you're not having that much sex.
So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia.
Now, this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups, and that's considered stigmatizing.
I've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing, whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing, but we'll leave that be.
The truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time.
And those groups are, globally, people who sell sex and their more regular partners.
They are gay men on the party scene who have, on average, three times more partners than straight people on the party scene.
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy, and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven, and one in three of all adults, are infected with HIV.
Now, in the rest of the world, we've got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very, very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk: drug injectors, sex workers and gay men.
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles: 25 percent prevalence among gay men.
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person.
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries.
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.
What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI.
No one wants it.
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
So essentially, you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.
But in "intimate" relations it's much more difficult because, with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things, we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy, and nothing is quite so unromantic as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.
So in the face of that, you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms.
This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now, but he is a reminder in the population, of why you might want to be using condoms.
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment.
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making.
So, what we've got -- some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much because, actually, treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
So, if you look at the viremia thing again, if you do start treatment when you're sick, well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?
Well, you die, so your viral load goes to zero.
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes -- which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy, or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs, or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever -- all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.
Let's just stop treating people."
Of course not, of course not.
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need.
That's simply not necessarily true, and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now.
And what we've seen is that, actually, condom use rates, which were very, very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV, with extremely little help from public health nerds, I would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really: One is the assumption of, "Oh well, if he's infected, he's probably on meds, and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you, and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day.
And that's boring, but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex, no matter how drunk you are, no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?
If we look at the data, we can see that the answer to that question is, mmm.
So these are data from Scotland.
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program.
Then it came way down.
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier.
But in gay men, you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available.
This is of new infections.
What does that mean?
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer, healthier lives, more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load, and that's a very worrisome thing.
What does it mean?
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.
Is that what's happening?
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days, and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers, unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.
But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims, we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view.
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta; she's a chick with a dick.
Why does she do that job?
Well, of course, because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia: on average, 20 cents.
It varies a bit province to province.
I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them for this particular slide, and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour.
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice.
Okay, Ines.
We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash, and commitment to preventing HIV too.
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?
It's all politics.
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."
So, from the point of view of a sex worker, politicians are making no sense.
From the point of view of a public health nerd, junkies are doing dumb things.
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet, and that's one of the glories of human existence.
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another, so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician, and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want.
But here's the thing: we are the voters.
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.
And everyone who's in this room, and everyone who's watching this out there on the web, I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense.
It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there, but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV.
Thank you.

<title>Ellen Dunham-Jones: Retrofitting suburbia</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Can we rebuild our broken suburbs? Ellen Dunham-Jones shares a vision of dying malls rehabilitated, dead "big box" stores re-inhabited, and endless parking lots transformed into thriving wetlands.</description>
In the last 50 years, we've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences.
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia.
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots, I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing, especially retail, sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places.
And in the process, what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost, and have the infrastructure in place, instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges.
So why is this important?
I think there are any number of reasons, and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S.
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of.
So strictly from the cities are already relatively green.
The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs.
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs, we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency.
We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically.
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting.
Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles.
And those have been linked then with the rather alarming, growing rates of obesity, shown in these maps here, and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes.
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore, again, because of our development patterns.
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.
I mean, how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices?
Suburban expansion to cheap land, for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream.
But increasingly, the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability -- which is basically our model -- those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs.
For instance, here in Atlanta, about half of households make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year, and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation.
I mean, that's 2005 figures.
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon.
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips, there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.
But is it practical?
I think it is.
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade, and we've found over 80 varied projects.
But that they're really all market driven, and what's driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts.
We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place, but that's really not the case anymore.
Since 2000, already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them.
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation.
They're still having kids -- but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child-rearing age.
They're the other big generation.
So as a result of that, demographers predict that through 2025, 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them.
And the market research, consumer research, asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like, what they would like to live in, tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia.
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place, and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle, but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.
The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt.
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band, but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots -- and suburbia is full of them.
When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown, it made sense to just build surface parking lots.
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location.
It no longer just makes sense.
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
It now makes sense to go back in, build a deck and build up on those sites.
So what do you do with a dead mall, dead office park?
It turns out, all sorts of things.
In a slow economy like ours, re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies.
So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re-inhabited as art-space.
It's now home to artist studios, theater groups, dance troupes.
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was, but it's serving its community.
It's keeping the lights on.
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes, as universities, and as all variety of office space.
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one.
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store, that is now a public library.
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse, they tore up some of the parking spaces, put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff, put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods.
And they've made this, what was just a store along a commercial strip, into a community gathering space.
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix, Arizona.
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint, a gourmet grocery, and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination.
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim, "Walking distance to Le Grande Orange," because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call "a third place."
If home is the first place and work is the second place, the third place is where you go to hang out and build community.
And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family, the family households, there's a real hunger for more third places.
So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category, the next strategy: redevelopment.
Now, during the boom, there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density, a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
But some of them have been much more incremental.
This is Mashpee Commons, the oldest retrofit that we've found.
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots.
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60's strip shopping center.
And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact, mixed-use New England village, and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side.
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
Sometimes, it's all at once.
This is another infill project on the parking lots, this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site, the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots and condo buildings, while keeping the existing office buildings.
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.
By 1980, it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right.
Today, the transit, the Main Street and the new housing have all been built.
Eventually, I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped.
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
So here's what it looks like.
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street.
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction.
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines.
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock.
It's now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets, two public parks, eight bus lines and a range of housing types, and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had.
Here was the mall in its heyday.
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.
So here's the site in 1975 with the mall.
By 1995, the mall has died.
The department store has been kept -- and we found this was true in many cases.
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.
They're easy to be re-adapted.
But the one story stuff ...
that's really history.
So here it is at projected build-out.
This project, I think, has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods.
It's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle.
It's about two-thirds built out right now.
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.
It's very successful, and it's helped to prompt -- eight of the 13 regional malls in Denver have now, or have announced plans to be, retrofitted.
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- No, it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties.
And so it's giving people more choices, but it's not taking away choices.
But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability.
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California.
They took the commercial strip shown on the black-and-white images below, and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town.
And it's transformed from being an ugly, unsafe, undesirable address, to becoming a beautiful, attractive, dignified sort of good address.
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it; they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree.
So there's a lot of great things, but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.
But densification is not going to work everywhere.
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer.
There's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint, Michigan.
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology, as in this example outside of Minneapolis.
When the shopping center died, the city restored the site's original wetlands, creating lakefront property, which then attracted private investment, the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years.
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time.
This is another re-greening example.
It also makes sense in very strong markets.
This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop.
And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.
But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat.
So I've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits.
What's next?
I think we have three challenges for the future.
The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale.
We need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened.
Where should we be redeveloping?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?
These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.
I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta 100 years from now.
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.
One, in a hundred years, transit on all major rail and road corridors.
Two, in a hundred years, thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors.
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
In a hundred years, subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won't be viable.
And so we've created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production.
So the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits.
And I close with this image of democracy in action: This is a protest that's happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland on an Astroturf town green.
Now, retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism, and not without reason; you don't get much more phony than an Astroturf town green.
I have to say, these are very hybrid places.
They are new but trying to look old.
They have urban streetscapes, but suburban parking ratios.
Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia, but they're less diverse than cities.
And they are public places, but that are managed by private companies.
And just the surface appearance are often -- like the Astroturf here -- they make me wince.
So, you know, I mean I'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job.
The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space, compromised as it may be, is still a really great thing.
But we've got to get the architecture better.
The final challenge is for all of you.
I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places -- more sustainable places, period.
But culturally, we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic, and we expect that.
But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to.
It's time to let them grow up, so I want you to all support the zoning changes, the road diets, the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
Thank you.

<title>Mitchell Besser: Mothers helping mothers fight HIV</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV infections are more prevalent and doctors scarcer than anywhere else in the world. With a lack of medical professionals, Mitchell Besser enlisted the help of his patients to create mothers2mothers -- an extraordinary network of HIV-positive women whose support for each other is changing and saving lives.</description>
I want you to take a trip with me.
Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa, and as you drive along, you look off to the side, and this is what you see: you see a field of graves.
And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.
And you go into the town, and you inquire, "What's going on here?"
and people are initially reluctant to tell you.
And then someone says, "These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."
HIV isn't like other medical conditions; it's stigmatizing.
People are reluctant to talk about it -- there's a fear associated with it.
And I'm going to talk about HIV today, about the deaths, about the stigma.
It's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story.
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV.
And as you can see, Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection.
There are 33 million people living with HIV in the world today.
Of these, two-thirds, 22 million are living in sub-Saharan Africa.
There are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV and of these, 90 percent are in sub-Saharan Africa.
We talk about things in relative terms.
And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV-positive mothers.
The United States -- a large country -- each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV who give birth to a child.
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country -- 8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.
And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital, outside of Johannesburg in South Africa, and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women giving birth -- a hospital the same as a country.
And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa, it just pales, because in South Africa, each year 300,000 mothers with HIV give birth to children.
So we talk about PMTCT, and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.
I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV-positive, she's going to infect her child.
The reality is really, very different.
In resource-rich countries, with all the tests and treatment we currently have, less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive -- 98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.
And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries, in the absence of tests and treatment, 40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected -- 40 percent versus two percent -- an enormous difference.
So these programs -- and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk -- these prevention programs, simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies, and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.
So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.
It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.
It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex.
It's an entire package of services, and it works.
So in the United States, since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s, there's been an 80-percent decline in the number of HIV-infected children.
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet, still, over 400,000 children are born every year in the world today with HIV.
What does that mean?
It means 1,100 children infected each day -- 1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.
And where do they come from?
Well, less than one comes from the United States.
One, on average, comes from Europe.
100 come from Asia and the Pacific.
And each day, a thousand babies -- a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa.
So again, I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.
And let's look at another map.
And here, again, we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.
That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.
And it's the same with nurses.
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa has 24 percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.
That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients.
A nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day, which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient.
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?
Well, back in 2001, when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug, a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient, would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test, explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine, explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding, and test the baby -- in minutes.
Well, fortunately since 2001, we've got new treatments, new tests, and we're far more successful, but we don't have any more nurses.
And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes.
It's not possible -- it doesn't work.
And so we need to find better ways of providing care.
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa -- mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.
These women are here for care, but we know that just doing a test, just giving someone a drug, it's not enough.
Meds don't equal medical care.
Doctors and nurses, frankly, don't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand.
I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do, and I expect them to follow my guidance -- because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard -- but the reality is, if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.
You should always use a condom," and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered -- what's going to happen?
If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so it's just not going to work.
And so we need to do more, we need to do it differently, we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale, which means it can be done everywhere.
So, I want to tell you a story -- I want to take you on a little trip.
Imagine yourself, if you can, you're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.
You go in for a test and you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.
And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.
And the nurse takes you into a room, and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby, and you hear none of it.
All you're hearing is, "I'm going to die, and my baby is going to die."
And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.
And you don't know who you can talk to, because the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home, you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support.
And this -- this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today.
But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news.
And I want to change the story a little bit.
Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test, takes her to a room.
The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies, and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.
They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.
And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says, "Welcome to mothers2mothers.
Have a seat. You're safe here.
We're all HIV-positive.
You're going to be okay. You're going to live.
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative."
We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource.
Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home.
So often the men are gone.
They're working, or they're not part of the household.
Our organization, mothers2mothers, enlists women with HIV as care providers.
We bring mothers who have HIV, who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities, to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team.
These mothers, we call them mentor mothers, are able to engage women who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies, have found out about being HIV-positive, who need support and education.
And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines, how to take care of themselves, how to take care of their babies.
Consider: if you needed surgery, you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?
But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life, you'd like to engage someone, someone who's had the procedure.
Patients are experts on their own experience, and they can share that experience with others.
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.
So the mothers who work for us, they come from the communities in which they work.
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses.
And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts, because their money's protected; the men can't take it away from them.
They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum-based education, training.
Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained.
But so often, they only get trained once, so they're not aware of new medicines, new guidelines as they come out.
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained.
And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts.
Imagine that: a woman, a former patient, being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she's taking care of.
Our organization has three goals.
The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive, keep the children alive -- no more orphans.
And the third, and maybe the most grand, is to find ways to empower women, enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV.
So how do we do it?
Well, maybe the most important engagement is the one-to-one, seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them, explaining how they can take care of themselves.
We go beyond that; we try to bring in the husbands, the partners.
In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care.
But in Rwanda, in one country, they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her -- that's the rule.
And so the father and the mother, together, go through the counseling and the testing.
The father and the mother, together, they get the results.
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma.
Disclosure is so central to prevention.
How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure?
Disclosure is so important to treatment, because again, people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly.
We also work in groups.
Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing, but what happens is women, they come together -- under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers -- they come together, and they share their personal experiences.
And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves, how to disclose how to take medicines.
And then there's the community outreach, engaging women in their communities.
If we can change the way households believe and think, we can change the way communities believe and think.
And if we can change enough communities, we can change national attitudes.
We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV.
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.
We have the medicines, we have the tests, but how do you reduce the stigma?
And it's important about disclosure.
So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back, and she told me a story.
She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client, because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status, and she was afraid to go by herself.
And so the mentor mother went along with.
And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings, "I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."
And everybody was quiet.
And then her oldest brother stood up and said, "I too have something to tell you.
I'm HIV-positive.
I've been afraid to tell everybody."
And then this older sister stood up and said, "I too am living with the virus, and I've been ashamed."
And then her younger brother stood up and said, "I'm also positive.
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family."
And you see where this is going.
The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.
I thought you were going to hate me."
And there they were, all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time.
Female Narrator: Women come to us, and they are crying and scared.
I tell them my story, that I am HIV-positive, but my child is HIV-negative.
I tell them, "You are going to make it, and you will raise a healthy baby."
I am proof that there is hope.
Mitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.
And it is a crisis in health care systems.
Even as we have more tests and more drugs, we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.
Task-shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it.
Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.
And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors, and so we need to find new paradigm for health care.
How do you build a better health care system?
We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.
And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs, the side effects.
They delegate education about infant feeding, family planning, safer sex, actions that nurses simple just don't have time for.
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.
The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.
And our organization helps women across that bridge.
The care doesn't stop when the baby's born -- we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby, ensuring that they live healthy, successful lives.
Our organization works on three levels.
The first, at the patient level -- mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV, keeping mothers healthy to raise them.
The second, communities -- empowering women.
They become leaders within their communities.
They change the way communities think -- we need to change attitudes to HIV.
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa.
We have to do that.
And then rework the level of the health care systems, building stronger health care systems.
Our health care systems are broken.
They're not going to work the way they're currently designed.
And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills, don't have the time -- our mentor mothers do.
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in, we can do that.
I started the program in Capetown, South Africa back in 2001.
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.
Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from, I was in the shower at the time -- I was alone.
The program is now working in nine countries, we have 670 program sites, we're seeing about 230,000 women every month, we're employing 1,600 mentor mothers, and last year, they enrolled 300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.
That is 20 percent of the global HIV-positive pregnant women -- 20 percent of the world.
What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.
Past patients taking care of present patients.
And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma.
Female Narrator: There is hope, hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS.
Each person must know their HIV status.
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative.
Those who are HIV-infected must know how to take care of themselves.
HIV-positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV-negative babies.
All of this is possible, if we each contribute to this fight.
MB: Simple solutions to complex problems.
Mothers caring for mothers.
It's transformational.
Thank you.

<title>Tristram Stuart: The global food waste scandal</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Western countries throw out nearly half of their food, not because it’s inedible -- but because it doesn’t look appealing. Tristram Stuart delves into the shocking data of wasted food, calling for a more responsible use of global resources.</description>
The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when I was 15 years old.
I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.
And I started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way.
I went to my school kitchen, and I said, "Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at."
I went to the local baker and took their stale bread.
I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets.
This was great. My pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork. I sold that pork to my school friends' parents, and I made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.
But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption, and that I was only scratching the surface, and that right the way up the food supply chain, in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes, in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.
Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting.
I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites, and I thought, surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it.
One morning, when I was feeding my pigs, I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time.
I grabbed hold of it, sat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs.
That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism, really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste, and the provision of the solution to food waste, which is simply to sit down and eat food, rather than throwing it away.
That became, as it were, a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food, and exposing, most importantly, to the public, that when we're talking about food being thrown away, we're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about stuff that's beyond the pale.
We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale.
Eventually, I set about writing my book, really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale. What this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world.
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist, and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted.
So I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country.
That's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on levels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.
That black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.
There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste-free world.
But that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure, nutritional diet for every person in that country.
Any dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world, represents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country.
As a country gets richer, it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants, and as you can see, most European and North American countries fall between 150 and 200 percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations.
So a country like America has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the American people.
But the thing that really struck me, when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers, was that you can see how it levels off.
Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark, and then they level off, and they don't really go on rising as you might expect.
So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false.
And that's what I came up with.
If you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants, but also the food that people feed to livestock, the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products, what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself.
A country like America has four times the amount of food that it needs.
When people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by 2050, I always think of these graphs.
The fact is, we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger.
We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.
In many ways, this is a great success story of human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.
It is a success story. It has been a success story.
But what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear, and when we chop down forests, as we are every day, to grow more and more food, when we extract water from depleting water reserves, when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food, and then we throw away so much of it, we have to think about what we can start saving.
And yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away.
I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there.
And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today.
So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply, okay? We start out with nine.
That's what's in fields around the world every single year.
The first biscuit we're going to lose before we even leave the farm.
That's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture, whether it's a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization, grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.
The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.
Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals, and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat, so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products.
Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins.
This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste, what ends up in the garbage, what ends up in supermarket bins, what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two, and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on.
That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources, especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world.
Having gone through the data, I then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up.
Where does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff on our plates, but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between?
Supermarkets are an easy place to start.
This is the result of my hobby, which is unofficial bin inspections.
Strange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores, we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back, opening up bins and having a look at what's inside.
But this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.
It represents a colossal waste of food, but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg.
When you start going up the supply chain, you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale.
Can I have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?
Who lives in a household where that crust -- that slice at the first and last end of each loaf -- who lives in a household where it does get eaten?
Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people, and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world, and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it?
I certainly haven't.
So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go?
This is the answer, unfortunately: 13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread.
In the same year that I visited this factory, I went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies.
We contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in Britain and elsewhere in the world. We take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on.
Go one step up, and you get to farmers, who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards.
This farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested, because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.
Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect, all going for pigs.
Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications, tomatoes in Tenerife, oranges in Florida, bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year, all being discarded. This is one day's waste from one banana plantation in Ecuador.
All being discarded, perfectly edible, because they're the wrong shape or size.
If we do that to fruit and vegetables, you bet we can do it to animals too.
Liver, lungs, heads, tails, kidneys, testicles, all of these things which are traditional, delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last 30 years.
As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best, or is incinerated.
This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China, is serving up his national dish.
It's called sheep's organs.
It's delicious, it's nutritious, and as I learned when I went to Kashgar, it symbolizes their taboo against food waste.
I was sitting in a roadside cafe.
A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl, and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl.
I thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken?
How have I insulted my host?"
He pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean."
I thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world telling people to stop wasting food.
This guy has thrashed me at my own game."
But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people, do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale, if we make noise about it, tell corporations about it, tell governments we want to see an end to food waste, we do have the power to bring about that change.
Fish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish are discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.
In our homes, we've lost touch with food.
This is an experiment I did on three lettuces.
Who keeps lettuces in their fridge?
Most people. The one on the left was kept in a fridge for 10 days.
The one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.
The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.
It's a living organism, cut the slice off, stuck it in a vase of water, it was all right for another two weeks after this.
Some food waste, as I said at the beginning, will inevitably arise, so the question is, what is the best thing to do with it?
I answered that question when I was 15.
In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago: We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food.
And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.
It's unscientific. It's unnecessary.
If you cook food for pigs, just as if you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.
It's also a massive saving of resources.
At the moment, Europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from South America, where its production contributes to global warming, to deforestation, to biodiversity loss, to feed livestock here in Europe.
At the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them.
If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save that amount of carbon.
If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste, to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity, you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.
We knew that during the war.
A silver lining: It has kicked off globally, the quest to tackle food waste.
Feeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009.
We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted.
Since then, it's happened again in London, it's happening internationally, and across the country.
It's a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it.
For the sake of the planet we live on, for the sake of our children, for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us, we are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land for food. At the moment, we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats.
Stop wasting food. Thank you very much.

<title>James Forbes: Compassion at the dinner table</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Join Rev. James Forbes at the dinner table of his Southern childhood, where his mother and father taught him what compassion really means day to day -- sharing with those who need love.</description>
Compassion: what does it look like?
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.
If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served.
Since mom had eight kids, sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.
Before we could eat, she would ask, "Are all the children in?"
And if someone happened to be missing, we would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven, then we could say grace, and we could eat.
Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person -- that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
For when one is honored, all are honored.
Also, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members, that is, extended members of the family, sick and elderly, shut in.
My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street, Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue, and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
Why? Because they were old and infirm, and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
For mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.
They are our family."
And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
They would offer sweets or money.
Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them, you must always say, 'Nothing.' And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'" This was the nature of being at that table.
In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy."
So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.
Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it.
And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal, is always wondering: Are all the children in?
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.
Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.
Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing, and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed, except that daddy messed it up.
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate.
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
We thought he must be out of his mind.
This is our time. This is intimate time.
This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?
Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
And mom overheard us and said, "Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.
That's what the celebration is all about.
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
So, we sucked up.
But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together.
We are sisters and brothers united together.
And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.
We're all strands in it.
And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
Now that's compassion.
So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture.
Talk about a picture of compassion.
I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled, walking across the bridge and going into Selma.
Just a photograph.
Arm in arm for struggle.
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being.
So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset.
You heard about riots all across the land.
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.
This is the picture. They said, "It's going to be too volatile for you to go."
He insisted, "I must go."
So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, "I have bad news for you.
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.
I know that you are angry, and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But," he said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.
I know how you feel."
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: "As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message.
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church: 9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, "That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city.
It was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.
We were all suffering.
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them.
'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature, but I became a preacher.
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too.
Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, "Some people preach the Gospel.
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
How do you make it real?
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it.
In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness.
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"
And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, "You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself."
And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'" And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."
And he said, "Here, this is the initial investment, but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.
And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity, but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that, 'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.
I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God's children would have their needs cared for, so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health, are all the children in?" And we could say yes.
Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.
I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going.
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say, and to be a good American -- for me, is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.
Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity.
We are one people together.
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.
We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.
The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.
It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor.
This is a season of grace.
Unusual things are beginning to happen.
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor.
And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children, remembering mama eternal.
Now, let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply, it usually takes the form of verse.
And so I want to close with a little song.
I close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion.
And this is why we do it.
The song says, ♫ "I made heaven so happy today, ♫ ♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫ That's compassion.

<title>Jenna McCarthy: What you don't know about marriage</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this funny, casual talk from TEDx, writer Jenna McCarthy shares surprising research on how marriages really work. One tip: Do not try to win an Oscar for best actress.</description>
Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
and not to have sex with anyone else, ever.
He buys a ring, she buys a dress.
They go shopping for all sorts of things.
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons.
And the big day comes.
And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with, and they'll vow that nothing, not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness, not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion.
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain, until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace.
You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore.
And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others' faces and do the "Macarena," and we'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time -- even though we know, statistically, half of them will be divorced within a decade.
Of course, the other half won't, right?
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll.
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore.
And researchers want to know why.
I mean, look, it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work.
Disrespect, boredom, too much time on Facebook, having sex with other people.
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket.
So what's going on when it doesn't?
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common?
What are they doing right?
What can we learn from them?
And if you're still happily sleeping solo, why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life?
Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out.
They stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism.
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends.
And it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities, actually, beyond they don't have sex with other people.
For instance, in the happiest marriages, the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband.
Obvious, right.
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because, women, we care a great deal about being thin and good looking, whereas men mostly care about sex ...
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are.
The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy; we just have to be thinner than our partners.
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising, we just need to wait for them to get fat, maybe bake a few pies.
This is good information to have, and it's not that complicated.
Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives.
For example, the happy wife.
Instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run, she might say, "Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner."
These are couples who can find good in any situation.
"Yeah, it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire, but it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars, and it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm."
One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work, the more attractive his wife will find him.
Because we needed a study to tell us this.
But here's what's going on here.
The more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have; the more sex they have, the nicer he is to her; the nicer he is to her, the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed -- and ultimately, they live happily ever after.
In other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department.
Here's an interesting one.
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce.
This is an actual study, and let me clarify.
The researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals.
The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures.
Now I don't know how old all of you are, but when I was a kid, your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film, and, by God, film was expensive.
They didn't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest, smileyest one for the Christmas card.
Oh no.
They dressed you up, they lined you up, and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye.
But still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce.
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage?
Do not win an Oscar for best actress.
I'm serious.
Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Hallie Berry, Hillary Swank, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon, all of them single soon after taking home that statue.
They actually call it the Oscar curse.
It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided.
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous.
It turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet.
Apparently, the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us, but it obviously hasn't and it probably never will, makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison.
And theoretically, I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash, we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good.
Drinking alcohol, it seems, is bad for your marriage.
Yeah.
I can't tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline.
But here's a scary one: Divorce is contagious.
That's right -- when you have a close couple friend split up, it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent.
Now I have to say, I don't get this one at all.
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony.
And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could.
So now you may be wondering, why does anyone get married ever?
Well the U.S. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse -- a list that includes visitation rights in jail, but hopefully you'll never need that one.
But beyond the profound federal perks, married people make more money.
We're healthier, physically and emotionally.
We produce happier, more stable and more successful kids.
We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends -- believe it or not.
We even live longer, which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place.
Now if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return, I can't tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce, but I can only encourage you to try, because the benefits, as I've pointed out, are significant.
The bottom line is, whether you're in it or you're searching for it, I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting.
So I hope you'll use the information I've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors.
For instance, in my marriage, I'd say I'm doing okay.
One the one hand, I have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome.
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up.
And like I said, we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up.
So we have to keep an eye on that.
And we do like a cocktail or two.
On the other hand, I have the fake happy picture thing.
And also, my husband does a lot around the house, and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives.
So I've got all those things going for me.
But just in case, I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon.
And for the good of your relationships, I would encourage you to do the same.
I'll see you at the bar.

I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.
I understand we have over 80 countries here, so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries.
In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference.
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?
Not the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child, where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.
Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment where my father, who never takes off from work, he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person, going to school to see his son, how he's doing, and the teacher said to him, he said, "You know, John is good at math and art."
And he kind of nodded, you know?
The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math."
And that always stuck with me all my life.
Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?
Why? It became a question my entire life, and that's all right, because being good at math meant he bought me a computer, and some of you remember this computer, this was my first computer.
Who had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool.
As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all.
You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.
It would say you're wrong most of the time.
That was the computer we knew.
That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however, I learned about the computer at all levels, and after, I went to art school to get away from computers, and I began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking.
And I was influenced by performance art -- so this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people.
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.
I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc., and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.
It's a room broken in two halves.
I've turned the computer on, and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.
And the floppy disk drive person wears it.
She finds the first sector on the disk, and takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.
So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc., and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really.
And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver, where it's XY.
It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is, it made me wonder about computers and technology in general.
And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.
The first three things are about how I've been curious about technology, design and art, and how they intersect, how they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on since four years ago I became the President And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment.
So starting from technology, technology is a wonderful thing.
When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.
It could show text and after we waited a bit, we had these things called images.
Remember when images were first possible with a computer, those gorgeous, full-color images?
And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer.
And then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing.
Remember that excitement?
And then the browser appeared. The browser was great, but the browser was very primitive, very narrow bandwidth.
Text first, then images, we waited, CD-quality sound over the Net, then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible.
And then the mobile phone occurred, text, images, audio, video. And now we have iPhone, iPad, Android, with text, video, audio, etc.
You see this little pattern here?
We're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense of possibility from computing is something I've been questioning for the last 10 or so years, and have looked to design, as we understand most things, and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.
And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson.
Designers talk about the relationship between form and content, content and form. Now what does that mean?
Well, content is the word up there: fear.
It's a four-letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word, fear.
Fear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful, and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica, it's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?" Right?
You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big, and like, whoa, that hurts. Fear.
So you can see how you change the scale, you change the form. Content is the same, but you feel differently.
You change the typeface to, like, this typeface, and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface, like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr! Fear!
Like, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny.
Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface.
Like, we gotta go to Fear.
It's, like, amazing, right?
It just changes the same content.
Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart, they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic, and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.
You feel for them.
Or you change the typeface to something like this.
It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear.
I can never get in there.
It's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content.
If you just change one letter in that content, you get a much better word, much better content: free.
"Free" is a great word. You can serve it almost any way.
Free bold feels like Mandela free.
It's like, yes, I can be free.
Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.
It feels great. Or even free spread out, it's like, ah, I can breathe in free, so easily.
And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove, and I have, like, Don Draper free.
So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.
It's a powerful thing. It's like magic, almost, like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic.
Design does that.
And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect, and I'm going to show you some old work I never really show anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do.
So -- yeah.
So I made a lot of work in the '90s.
This was a square that responds to sound.
People ask me why I made that. It's not clear.
But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me, and my kids were small then, and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah," you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that.
We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.
And they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"
And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?
So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself, so I had to hang up my mouse.
But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white, monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.
It's called "Tap, Type, Write."
It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.
It has 10 variations.
There's a shift.
Ten variations. This is, like, spin the letter around.
This is, like, a ring of letters.
This is 20 years old, so it's kind of a -- Let's see, this is — I love the French film "The Red Balloon."
Great movie, right? I love that movie. So, this is sort of like a play on that.
It's peaceful, like that.
I'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know.
It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.
If you hit G, life's okay, so I always say, "Hit G, and it's going to be all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So that was 20 years ago, and I was always on the periphery of art.
By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art, and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?
It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say, like, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great.
Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable.
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples of animal, bone, mineral, plants.
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.
And why do we have this facility?
Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal, the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.
At RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.
And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it, something we should figure out what is good about how we did it, even in this new era.
And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo, but when he was based in London, he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops, and the game was as such: When we look at an antique we want, we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique, and if it's a good story, we'll buy it.
So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup, and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."
And the shopkeeper would say, "It's old."
"Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old."
And he saw, over and over, the antique's value was all about it being old.
And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said, you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.
People say, "Wow, your art, what is it?" It's new media.
And he realized, it isn't about old or new.
It's about something in between.
It isn't about "old," the dirt, "new," the cloud. It's about what is good.
A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.
You see it in all interesting art today, in all interesting businesses today. How we combine those two together to make good is very interesting.
So art makes questions, and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.
We aren't functioning so easily anymore.
We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.
As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.
But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people, and it was the best sign ever to say no.
It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
My favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure.
And also "no love."
So that is authoritarianism.
And what is that, structurally?
It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted.
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.
It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward.
And so today, leaders are faced with how to lead differently, I believe.
This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership. What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead?
Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.
Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.
A traditional leader is always wanting to be right, whereas a creative leader hopes to be right.
And this frame is important today, in this complex, ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe.
And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox, and I said great.
And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight, six hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London, and that was really bad.
But I would listen to people, hear their issues, draw in the sand, try to figure things out, and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.
You know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days.
And it felt kind of like being president, actually.
I was like, "Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?"
And by the end of the experience, I realized why I was doing this.
It's because leaders, what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen, and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London, and so leadership, connecting people, is the great question today.
Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy, it's a wonderful design challenge.
And one thing I've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective.
Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually.
So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop?
This is called Powershop, and the way it works is imagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization.
There may be different subdivisions in the organization, and you might want to look into different areas. For instance, green are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly.
You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect, make things happen? So for instance, you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there, and know that you know someone in Eco, over here, and these people here are in Eco, the people you might engage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy.
And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas, and so you might look in R&amp;D, and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest, and it's a person important to engage.
So you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display on how you're interacting with them.
How many coffees do you have?
How often are you calling them, emailing them?
What is the tenor of their email? How is it working out?
Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.
You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso, the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications?
So these kind of systems, I believe, are important.
They're targeted social media systems around leaders.
And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design, because art and design lets you think like this, find different systems like this, and I've just begun thinking like this, so I'm glad to share that with you.
So in closing, I want to thank all of you for your attention. Thanks very much.

<title>Emiliano Salinas: A civil response to violence</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this passionate talk that's already caused a sensation in Mexico, Emiliano Salinas, son of former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, confronts the current climate of violence in Mexico -- or rather, how Mexican society responds to it. He calls on ordinary citizens to move from denial and fear to peaceful, community-based action. </description>
My name is Emiliano Salinas and I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now.
I was born in 1976.
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.
As a child, I had a pretty normal life: I would go to school, play with my friends and cousins.
But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed.
What I'm about to say, at least some of what I'm about to say, will cause controversy.
Firstly, because I'm the one who's going to say it.
And secondly, because what I'm going to say is true, and it will make a lot of people nervous because it's something we don't want to hear.
But it's imperative that we listen because it's undeniable and definitive.
It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons.
I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon, and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence.
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son from the fact that I'm a citizen concerned about the country's current situation.
Don't worry.
It's not necessary for understanding the importance of what I'm going to say.
I think we have a problem in Mexico.
We have a big problem.
I think there's consensus on this.
No one argues -- we all agree there's a problem.
What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is.
Is it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?
I think none of these is the problem.
I don't mean they don't deserve attention.
But we won't be able to take care of any of those things if we don't solve the real problem we have in Mexico first.
The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans, we believe we are victims of our circumstances.
We are a country of victims.
Historically, we've always acted as victims of something or somebody.
We were victims of the Spaniards.
Then we were victims of the French.
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio.
Then we were victims of the PRI.
Even of Salinas.
And of El Peje.
And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
Hold on! Wait a minute!
What if none of these things is the problem?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of.
The problem is that we play the role of victims.
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.
If only we stopped feeling like victims, if we stopped acting as victims, our country would change so much!
I'm going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible, involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands.
I'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence, from weakest to strongest.
The first level, the weakest level of civil response against violence, is denial and apathy.
Today, much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we're going through.
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances.
Daily life in our country is, to say the least, under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.
It's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away.
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu.
But it doesn't.
Mexico has cancer.
And if we don't do something about it, the cancer will end up killing it.
We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response, which is, effectively, recognition.
And that recognition will sow fear -- recognizing the seriousness of the situation.
But, fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something.
Many people in Mexico are afraid today.
We're very afraid.
And we're acting out of that fear.
And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear -- and this is the second level of civil response: fear.
Let's think about Mexican streets: they're unsafe because of violence, so people stay at home.
Does that make streets more or less safe?
Less safe!
So streets become more desolate and unsafe, so we stay home more -- which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe, and we stay home even more.
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses, scared to death -- even more afraid than when we were out on the streets.
We need to confront this fear.
We need to move Mexican society, the members of society who are at this level, to the next level, which is action.
We need to face our fears and take back our streets, our cities, our neighborhoods.
For many people, acting involves courage.
We go from fear to courage.
They say, "I can't take it anymore.
Let's do something about it."
Recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in Mexico.
Usually it's one or two a year.
Now we're experiencing one every week.
This shows that society is desperate and it's taking the law into its own hands.
Unfortunately, violent action -- though action is better than no action -- but taking part in it only disguises violence.
If I'm violent with you and you respond with violence, you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence.
So civil action is vital, but it's also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level, which is non-violent action.
It's pacific, coordinated civil action, which doesn't mean passive action.
It means it's determined and effective, but not violent.
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico.
Two years ago, in Galena City, Chihuahua, a member of the community was kidnapped, Eric Le Barón.
His brothers, Benjamín and Julián, got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action: to pay the ransom, to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help.
In the end, Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together.
So what did they do?
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón to go to Chihuahua, where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city.
They sent a message to the kidnappers: "If you want your ransom come and get it.
We'll be waiting for you right here."
They stayed there.
Seven days later, Eric was set free and was able to return home.
This is an example of what an organized society can do, a society that acts.
Of course, criminals can respond.
And in this case, they did.
On July 7th, 2009, Benjamín Le Barón was murdered.
But Julián Le Barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year.
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head.
But he keeps fighting.
He keeps organizing.
He keeps mobilizing.
These heroic acts are present all over the country.
With a thousand Juliáns working together, Mexico would be a very different country.
And they're out there!
They just have to raise their hands.
I was born in Mexico, I grew up in Mexico and along the way, I learned to love Mexico.
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all Mexican people -- will agree that it's not difficult to love Mexico.
I've traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have.
That devotion we feel for the national football team.
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters, such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year's floods.
The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem since we were kids.
When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy, and we sang, with a childlike heart, "a soldier in each son."
I think the biggest insult, the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother.
A mother is the most sacred thing in life.
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children.
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history.
Our mother, Mexico, is being violated before our very eyes.
What are we going to do?
Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here.
Where is the soldier in each son?
Mahatma Gandhi, one of the greatest civil fighters of all time, said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world."
Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.
We need Gandhis.
We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action.
This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative.
This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico -- the festivals, the markets, the restaurants, the cantinas, the tequila, the mariachis, the serenades, the posadas, El Grito, the Day of the Dead, San Miguel, the joy, the passion for life, the fight and everything it means to be Mexican -- doesn't disappear from this world.
We're facing a very powerful opponent.
But we are many more.
They can take a man's life.
Anyone can kill me, or you, or you.
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans.
The battle is won, but we still have to fight it.
2000 years ago, the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican.
He said, "Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor, and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living."
Thank you.

<title>Evelyn Glennie: How to truly listen</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this soaring demonstration, deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your eardrums.</description>
I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning.
But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.
One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people.
Of course, my job is all about listening, and my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.
That's my only real aim in life.
And it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big, big job.
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music -- for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page.
And, you know, we open it up and I read the music.
So technically, I can actually read this.
I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.
I will do exactly as I'm told.
And so therefore, because time is short, if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward.
There's nothing too difficult about the piece.
But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.
I'm being told where to play on the drum.
I'm being told which part of the stick to use.
And I'm being told the dynamic.
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.
Snares on, snares off.
So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea.
And so on. My career would probably last about five years.
However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music.
Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher.
But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting, and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.
So there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation.
Now my career may last a little longer!
But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on.
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc.
However, that's just, you know, the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look, and we try to interpret, but actually it's so unbelievably shallow.
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do.
Just the basic feeling.
However, that is simply not enough.
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen, listen.
We have to listen to ourselves, first of all.
If I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.
By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.
If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more.
And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum.
And I'm doing far, far less.
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them.
Not just translate them, but interpret them.
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is, someone who is basically a percussion player ...
And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ...
And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- -- thinking about.
And I remember when I was 12 years old, and I started playing tympani and percussion, and my teacher said, "Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that. So what's the problem?"
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? How are you going to hear that?"
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."
And I said, "Well, I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums -- in particular, the kettle drums, or tympani -- to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like ...
that of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ...
and it's amazing that when you do open your body up, and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference ...
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.
Because of course, the ear is, I mean, subject to all sorts of things.
The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks ... etc., etc.
They're all different.
Same amount of weight, but different sound colors.
And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings, but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things.
And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue, you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician."
And I just couldn't quite accept that.
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice -- they accepted me. And not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.
And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not.
So therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions.
And I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world.
The interesting thing about this as well, though -- -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us, and we well know that music really is our daily medicine.
I say "music," but actually I mean "sound."
Because you know, some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. -- suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost -- I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps -- but something like this. Let me change.
Something that's so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, because I'm on top of the sound.
I have the sound coming this way.
He would have the sound coming through the resonators.
If there were no resonators on here, we would have ...
So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either.
Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting, will experience this sound quite, quite differently.
And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce -- for example, this sound.
Can you hear anything?
Exactly. Because I'm not even touching it.
But yet, we get the sensation of something happening.
In the same way that when I see tree moves, then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound.
Do you see what I mean?
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.
So there's always, always that huge -- I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth.
Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of.
So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work.
It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be ...
Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well.
But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.
The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad, so huge, so incredible! There's always something -- it may sound good up there, may not be so good there.
May be great there, but terrible up there.
Maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced.
And so therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound.
And this is quite interesting.
I cannot, you know, give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying, "Well, how on Earth can they experience music? You know, they're deaf."
We just -- we go like that, and we imagine that that's what deafness is about.
Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about.
If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk.
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk.
In a year's time, it could be two extra steps.
In another year's time, three extra steps.
Those are hugely important aspects to think about.
So when we do listen to each other, it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills, to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment.
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece.
Oh no, I don't like that piece." And so on.
And you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.
And you know, it's just one of the great things about being a musician, is that it is so unbelievably fluid.
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this.
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder.
Now, I don't mean just the sound; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.
And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try.
Very good! Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow?
Audience: No.
Evelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping. Try again.
Try again. Snow.
See, you're awake.
Rain. Not bad. Not bad.
You know, the interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question.
Now -- great imagination, thank you very much.
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think, "Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe ...
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds.
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.
In the same way that when we listen to music, we assume that it's all being fed through here.
This is how we experience music. Of course it's not.
We experience thunder -- thunder, thunder. Think, think, think.
Listen, listen, listen. Now -- what can we do with thunder?
I remember my teacher. When I first started, my very first lesson, I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go.
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle, sticks in a more-or-less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc.
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." -- where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum, because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week."
So, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks; I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell, experimented with the head.
Experimented with my body, experimented with jewelry, experimented with all sorts of things.
And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -- but nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience, because then, where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book?
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books.
So for example, one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player, as opposed to a musician, is basically straightforward single stroke rolls.
Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.
And so on and so forth. What does this piece require?
Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?
And that's exactly what he did.
And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student at a so called "music institution," all of that went out of the window.
We had to study from study books.
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to?
I need to play a piece of music." "Oh, well, this will help your control!"
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? I need to relate it to a piece of music.
You know. I need to say something.
"Why am I practicing paradiddles?
Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? Why am I doing that?
I need to have the reason, and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound, we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people.
But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage.
That's up to you, when you walk through a hall.
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.
I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play certain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing.
So please, the next time you go to a concert, just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber.
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is.
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.
They're experiencing that rawness there.
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening.
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.
But thank you very much for having me!

<title>Adam Sadowsky: How to engineer a viral music video</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The band OK Go dreamed up the idea of a massive Rube Goldberg machine for their next music video -- and Adam Sadowsky's team was charged with building it. He tells the story of the effort and engineering behind their labyrinthine creation that quickly became the YouTube sensation "This Too Shall Pass."</description>
Hi there.
I'm going to be talking a little bit about music, machines and life.
Or, more specifically, what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video.
Some of you may recognize this image.
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.
We'll be showing the video at the end, but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted.
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go -- the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.
And we were very excited about this because, of course, they have a history of dancing with machines.
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."
50-million-plus views on YouTube.
Four guys dancing on treadmills, no cuts, just a static camera.
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
So we were really excited about working with them.
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.
And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.
Now, for those of you who don't know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption, an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task.
So we were excited by this idea, and we started talking about exactly what it would look like.
And we came up with some parameters, because, you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations, but it also is pretty wide open.
And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video.
So we came up with a list of requirements, the "10 commandments," and they were, in order of ascending difficulty: The first is "No magic."
Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer.
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it, then we couldn't use it in the video.
They wanted band integration, that is, the machine acting upon the band members, specifically not the other way around.
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
So as the song picks up emotion, so should the machine get grander in its process.
They wanted us to make use of the space.
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using, divided between two floors.
It included an exterior loading dock.
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.
The machine itself would start the music.
So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.
Okay.
They wanted it to end precisely on time.
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.
And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song.
And as if that wasn't enough, all of these incredibly complicating things, right, they wanted it in one shot.
Okay.
So, just some statistics about what we went through in the process.
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction.
Of those 85 takes, only three actually successfully completed their run.
We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process.
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner, and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff.
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
And it's actually in the machine.
So what did we learn from all of this?
Well, having completed this, we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things.
And we learned that small stuff stinks.
Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust, and they fall out of the tracks, the exact angles makes it hard to get right.
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
It doesn't matter what temperature it is, doesn't matter what's in its way; it will pretty much get where it needs to go.
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go.
And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.
Small stuff stinks, but, of course, it's essential, right?
What else? Planning is incredibly important.
You know, we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things.
It's been said that, "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."
I think our enemy was physics -- and she's a cruel mistress.
Often, we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.
These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine.
So also, put reliable stuff last, the stuff that's going to run every time.
Again, small to large is relevant here.
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big, real car near the end of the video.
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem.
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.
So you put that up front so that, if it fails, at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing.
Life can be messy.
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it.
So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad, "This Too Shall Pass."
Thank you very much.
And now to introduce their music video, we have OK Go.
OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.
We are OK Go.
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!
It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.
Let me start again.
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."
Tim's sundial hat.
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?
Sorry, start again.
Dogs.
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go, and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."
[unclear] Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
That one's pretty good. It's getting better.

<title>James Hansen: Why I must speak out about climate change</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Top climate scientist James Hansen tells the story of his involvement in the science of and debate over global climate change. In doing so he outlines the overwhelming evidence that change is happening and why that makes him deeply worried about the future.</description>
What do I know that would cause me, a reticent, Midwestern scientist, to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting?
And what would you do if you knew what I know?
Let's start with how I got to this point.
I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university.
And I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first U.S. satellites.
Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus, that there was intense microwave radiation.
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?
Or was Venus extremely hot?
The right answer, confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft, was that Venus was very hot -- 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus.
Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus, which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid.
But while our instrument was being built, I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth, because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing.
Eventually, I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important.
Its changes will affect all of humanity.
The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century.
British physicist John Tyndall, in the 1850's, made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation, which is heat.
And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat, thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface.
I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations.
In 1981, we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2.
That Earth would likely warm in the 1980's, and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century.
We also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones, creation of drought-prone regions in North America and Asia, erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.
All of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under way.
That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to Congress in the 1980's, testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle.
Heatwaves and droughts on one hand, directly from the warming, but also, because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy, rainfall will become in more extreme events.
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding.
Global warming hoopla became time-consuming and distracted me from doing science -- partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony.
So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others.
By 15 years later, evidence of global warming was much stronger.
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts.
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force.
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels.
By then we had two grandchildren, Sophie and Connor.
I decided that I did not want them in the future to say, "Opa understood what was happening, but he didn't make it clear."
So I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy.
I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
This led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters.
After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions, NASA was forced to end the censorship.
But there were consequences.
I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement, "To understand and protect the home planet," to justify my talks.
Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted, never to appear again.
Over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies, while still researching the physics of climate change.
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first, from Earth's energy balance and, second, from Earth's climate history.
Adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed.
It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space, so there's a temporary energy imbalance.
More energy is coming in than going out, until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.
So the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance.
Is there more energy coming in than going out?
If so, more warming is in the pipeline.
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.
Now finally, we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs.
The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured, until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean.
These floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate.
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate, and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet.
And the land, to depths of tens of meters, is also warming.
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
That may not sound like much, but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.
It's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
It's equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year.
That's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day.
This imbalance, if we want to stabilize climate, means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm, parts per million, back to 350 ppm.
That is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming.
Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change.
But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record, when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least.
Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out.
This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses, mainly from burning fossil fuels.
Now consider Earth's climate history.
These curves for global temperature, atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores, from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet.
As you see, there's a high correlation between temperature, CO2 and sea level.
Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries.
Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying, "Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change, not vice versa."
But that lag is exactly what is expected.
Small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth.
When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.
Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker, so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer.
A warmer ocean releases CO2, just as a warm Coca-Cola does.
And more CO2 causes more warming.
So CO2, methane, and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge, even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing.
The important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today.
The physics does not change.
As Earth warms, now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere, ice will melt, and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost.
While we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur, it is certain they will occur, unless we stop the warming.
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning.
Precise measurements by GRACE, the gravity satellite, reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass, several hundred cubic kilometers per year.
And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago.
Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost.
What sea level rise can we look forward to?
The last time CO2 was 390 ppm, today's value, sea level was higher by at least 15 meters, 50 feet.
Where you are sitting now would be under water.
Most estimates are that, this century, we will get at least one meter.
I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels, perhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet, this century or shortly thereafter.
The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control.
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries.
There would be no stable shoreline.
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable.
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world.
What may be more reprehensible, if climate denial continues, is extermination of species.
The monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.
Global warming is already affecting people.
The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico heatwave and drought last year, Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003, were all exceptional events, more than three standard deviations outside the norm.
Fifty years ago, such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area.
In recent years, because of global warming, they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50.
So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural; they were caused by global warming.
An important impact, if global warming continues, will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world, the Midwest and Great Plains, which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts, worse than the Dust Bowl, within just a few decades, if we let global warming continue.
How did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate, giving talks in 10 countries, getting arrested, burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years?
More grandchildren helped me along.
Jake is a super-positive, enthusiastic boy.
Here at age two and a half years, he thinks he can protect his two and a half-day-old little sister.
It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control.
Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple, honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis, with the government not keeping one dime.
Most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they'd pay in increased prices.
This fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations, creating millions of jobs.
It is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future.
Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition.
Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly: "Transparent. Market-based.
Does not enlarge government.
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices.
Sounds like a conservative climate plan."
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society, our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide, thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel -- mountaintop removal, longwall mining, fracking, tar sands, tar shale, deep ocean Arctic drilling.
This path, if continued, guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations.
A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction.
And increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world, causing massive famines and economic decline.
Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth.
That is the equivalent of what we face now.
Yet, we dither, taking no action to divert the asteroid, even though the longer we wait, the more difficult and expensive it becomes.
If we had started in 2005, it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century.
If we start next year, it is six percent per year.
If we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year -- extremely difficult and expensive, perhaps impossible.
But we aren't even starting.
So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm.
Clearly, I haven't gotten this message across.
The science is clear.
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively.
We owe it to our children and grandchildren.
Thank you.

<title>Laura Snyder: The Philosophical Breakfast Club</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 1812, four men at Cambridge University met for breakfast. What began as an impassioned meal grew into a new scientific revolution, in which these men -- who called themselves “natural philosophers” until they later coined “scientist” -- introduced four major principles into scientific inquiry. Historian and philosopher Laura Snyder tells their intriguing story.</description>
I'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century, specifically to June 24, 1833.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.
It's the first night of the meeting, and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever.
An elderly, white-haired man stands up.
The members of the Association are shocked to realize that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who hadn't even left his house in years until that day.
They're even more shocked by what he says.
"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs.
They were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the British Association.
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience.
He politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist.
"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term," he said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,' we may form 'scientist.'" This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public, only 179 years ago.
I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school, and it kind of blew me away.
I mean, how could the word scientist not have existed until 1833?
What were scientists called before?
What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment?
Prior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs.
Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils, like Charles Darwin, for example, or, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley, who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen.
After this, they were scientists, professionals with a particular scientific method, goals, societies and funding.
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in 1812: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.
These were brilliant, driven men who accomplished amazing things.
Charles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters, invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer.
John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere, and, in his spare time, co-invented photography.
I'm sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx.
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist, as well as the words anode, cathode and ion, but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides.
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813, the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.
They talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution.
They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century.
It was time for a new revolution, which they pledged to bring about, and what's so amazing about these guys is, not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams, but they actually carried them out, even beyond their wildest dreams.
And I'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made.
About 200 years before, Francis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton, had proposed an inductive scientific method.
Now that's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws, which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise.
However, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different, deductive method.
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics, this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too.
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.
They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers, university students and members of the public.
Reading one of Herschel's books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say, "Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me.
It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge."
It also shaped Darwin's scientific method, as well as that used by his peers.
[Science for the public good] Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen, or for one's own personal gain.
For example, ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains.
The philosophical breakfast club changed that, working together.
Whewell's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge to all ship captains.
Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa, and, as he complained to Whewell, he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.
The four men really helped each other in every way.
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society.
In the days before pocket calculators, the numbers that most professionals needed -- bankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers — were to be found in lookup books like this, filled with tables of figures.
These tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers, but these calculations were really difficult.
I mean, this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year.
Each month required 1,365 calculations, so these tables were filled with mistakes.
Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables.
Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans.
This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California, and it calculates accurately. It actually works.
Later, Babbage's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.
It had a separate memory and central processor.
It was capable of iteration, conditional branching and parallel processing, and it was programmable using punched cards, an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.
Tragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non-human computers would have no usefulness for the public.
[New scientific institutions] Founded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London was the foremost scientific society in England and even in the rest of the world.
By the 19th century, it had become a kind of gentleman's club populated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.
The members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies, including the British Association.
These new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results.
They reinstated the tradition of the Q&amp;A after scientific papers were read, which had been discontinued by the Royal Society as being ungentlemanly.
And for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.
Members were encouraged to bring their wives, daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association, and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one, they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.
The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members.
[External funding for science] Up to the 19th century, natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies.
Occasionally, there were prizes, such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century, for solving the so-called longitude problem, but prizes were only given after the fact, when they were given at all.
On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club, the British Association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish, shipbuilding, and many other areas.
These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research, but they also encouraged thinking outside the box, rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.
Eventually, the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit, and this has become -- fortunately it's become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today.
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist.
That's the heroic part of their story.
There's a flip side as well.
They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution.
They would have been deeply dismayed by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.
It's shocking to realize that only 28 percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy, and this was tested by asking simple questions like, "Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"
and "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"
Once scientists became members of a professional group, they were slowly walled off from the rest of us.
This is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends.
Charles Darwin said, "I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work."
In fact, "Origin of Species" was written for a general and popular audience, and was widely read when it first appeared.
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten, that science is not only for scientists.
Thank you.

<title>Zach Kaplan + Keith Schacht: Toys and materials from the future</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The Inventables guys, Zach Kaplan and Keith Schacht, demo some amazing new materials and how we might use them. Look for squishy magnets, odor-detecting ink, "dry" liquid and a very surprising 10-foot pole.</description>
Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.
We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years, we found over 200 of these things, and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED.
Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding.
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.
Keith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.
What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.
Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this.
We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized: it's when we see something unexpected, it changes our understanding of the way things work.
As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time, if you assume that all magnets had to be hard, then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work.
ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible, we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.
So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise, and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.
You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet, and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.
For me, I really love this idea.
If you come to my apartment and see my closet, I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.
KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.
But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference.
ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A., and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.
He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company, The Directors Bureau.
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know, we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face: Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder; he opens it up and Keith and I look in, and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.
When we were going in the car back to the airport, we were thinking: why was this so powerful?
And as we thought about it more, we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience, just as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future.
Narrator: Do you have a need for speed?
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out?
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out, just the concept is.
ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.
The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.
Now this is important for two reasons.
One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.
In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right, the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.
So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.
The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force, would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.
It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.
When you get to the very bottom of the slide -- -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.
And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint.
KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.
Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.
Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it, but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling, the greater the stopping force.
ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole, and I have it right here in my pocket.
There're a few different versions of it.
KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.
They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made stable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.
ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently -- he was telling us that, in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base.
In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal: so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.
KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is, you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.
So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.
Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house -- I do it that way.
Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick.
Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.
Woman: An olive server.
Man: Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.
Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving, you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up, and you could swim easier ... Yeah.
ZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration, and so we need a volunteer from the audience.
You sir, come on up.
Come on up. Tell everybody your name.
Steve Jurvetson: Steve.
ZK: It's Steve. All right Steve, now, follow me.
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.
Right there. That's great.
And hold onto this. Good luck to you.
KS: No, not yet.
ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target.
KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect.
Now, Zach, we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future.
So here, come on up to the front. All right, so now if you'll see here -- no, no, it's OK.
So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.
SJ: It's cold.
KS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.
It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.
It's so safe you could drink this stuff.
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water.
All right, well thanks for coming up.
ZK: Wait, wait, Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends.
SJ: Excellent, thank you.
KS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.
So what's the significance of this dry liquid?
Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.
Now, the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet, that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.
So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage.
You can circulate it to draw the heat away.
But today it's most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.
Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.
But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime, it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down, and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.
ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&amp;D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer.
While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.
We have a video to show you.
KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.
It's technically called, "shape-retaining property."
Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil, and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back.
ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist, but doesn't use a buckle.
Taking it a little further, if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth: so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table, so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.
For our next technology, it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.
So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.
KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.
So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.
Now, to think about the potential for this, think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards, on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink, you could change the way you interact with it.
ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.
You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on, based on the curvature of the pages.
In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.
KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works.
Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.
Who are you?
New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.
OMC: I used to smell like you.
Narrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.
Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.
Don't let milk spoil your morning.
ZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys: Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.
KS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.
And these dyes change color in response to odors.
So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.
But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect, then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.
ZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself, and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible, beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.
His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn, how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?
And he kind of comically explained that time after time, what the firemen would say is: they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around; if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.
I mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.
But more seriously, they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans, and say if it's safe for the firemen.
In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing, where they're working on medical equipment.
So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses, or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results.
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.
Currently, they're using a method of trial and error, but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.
KS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating.
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this, we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket; something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent; every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.
ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.
I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators, and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box, one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand -- the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.
And you know, his son was mesmerized, because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair.
And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said, "Look, hydrophobic string."
I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.
Thank you very much.
KS: Thank you.

<title>Rose George: Let's talk crap. Seriously.</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It's 2013, yet 2.5 billion people in the world have no access to a basic sanitary toilet. And when there's no loo, where do you poo? In the street, probably near your water and food sources -- causing untold death and disease from contamination. Get ready for a blunt, funny, powerful talk from journalist Rose George about a once-unmentionable problem.</description>
Let's talk dirty.
A few years ago, oddly enough, I needed the bathroom, and I found one, a public bathroom, and I went into the stall, and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life: use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.
And for some reason that day, instead, I asked myself a question, and it was, where does this stuff go?
And with that question, I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation -- there's more coming -- — sanitation, toilets and poop, and I have yet to emerge.
And that's because it's such an enraging, yet engaging place to be.
To go back to that toilet, it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet, it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization.
That's the other WTO.
But it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water, it had soap so I could wash my hands, and I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.
But that day, when I asked that question, I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right, when in fact it's a privilege.
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.
They don't have a bucket or a box.
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.
And they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway, which is called open defecation, or poo-pooing in the open.
And he does that every day, and every day, probably, that guy in the picture walks on by, because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.
But he should, because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers.
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.
All those things, the eggs, the cysts, the bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel in one gram of human feces.
How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.
He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house, and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.
In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in, the most common symptoms associated with those diseases, diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.
It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.
Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly, as a legacy of empire.
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency, this is the picture that you come up with.
Still not sure about the bikini.
And here's another image of diarrhea.
This is Marie Saylee, nine months old.
You can't see her, because she's buried under that green grass in a little village in Liberia, because she died in three days from diarrhea -- the Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.
And that's her dad.
But she wasn't alone that day, because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea, and they do every day.
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide, and you've probably been asked to care about things like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles, but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together.
It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.
And the cost to the world is immense: 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation.
These are cholera beds in Haiti.
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases.
But we know how to fix this.
We know, because in the mid-19th century, wonderful Victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.
Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history.
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal, and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia, and surgery.
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.
But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell, we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door — and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.
We don't have a neutral word for it.
Poop's not particularly adequate.
Shit offends people. Feces is too medical.
Because I can't explain otherwise, when I look at the figures, what's going on.
We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation, but if you look at the budgets of countries, developing and developed, you'll think there's something wrong with the math, because you'll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation, even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year.
But then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget, and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply, which is great; we all need water.
No one's going to refuse clean water.
But the humble latrine, or flush toilet, reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water.
Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house, he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply, but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.
And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development, because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us.
So a toilet can put a girl back in school.
Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation.
They've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in.
We've all done that, but they do it every day, and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating, it just gets too much.
And I understand that. Who can blame them?
So if you met an educationalist and said, "I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing," you'd make a lot of friends in education.
That's not the only thing it can do for you.
Poop can cook your dinner.
It's got nutrients in it.
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.
We don't keep them all.
In Rwanda, they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels.
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.
They're genocidal inmates, most of them, and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines, because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank, pretty much like a stomach, then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas, and you can cook with it.
And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit, but it's also good economic sense, because they're saving a million dollars a year.
They're cutting down on deforestation, and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible, infinite and free at the point of production.
It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.
Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes, which is what you think it is, except not quite, because it's actually donated.
There is now a new career path called stool donor.
It's like the new sperm donor.
Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff, and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.
She's been suffering for years.
She gets a dose of healthy human feces, and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.
It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.
Maybe it's the ick factor.
That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample, a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.
So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple, we give everyone a toilet.
And this is where it gets really interesting, because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.
So the really interesting, exciting work -- this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology.
We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware.
They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground.
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century.
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.
In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.
It's called "No Loo, No I Do."
And in case you think that poster's just propaganda, here's Priyanka, 23 years old.
I met her last October in India, and she grew up in a conservative environment.
She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India, and she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so, she moved into her in-law's house.
And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet.
She'd grown up with a latrine.
It was no big deal, but it was a latrine.
And the first night she was there, she was told that at 4 o'clock in the morning -- her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open.
And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.
She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.
After three days, she did an unthinkable thing.
She left.
And if you know anything about rural India, you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.
But not just that.
She got her toilet, and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing.
It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful and really exciting.
Another version of this, another village in India near where Priyanka lives is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago, it had no toilets whatsoever.
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.
Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other.
Somehow, people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought, "Oops."
Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.
That's what really made them change their behavior.
So this woman, this boy's mother installed this latrine in a few hours.
Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind, but she installed the latrine in a few hours.
It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.
So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation, even though these are pretty exciting times because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reinventing the toilet, which is great, we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike, which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.
But there are things to worry about.
It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.
It's about 50 or so years off track.
We're not going to meet targets, providing people with sanitation at this rate.
So when I get sad about sanitation, I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks, and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos, washlet toilets.
They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely, hands-free cleaning experience, and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device which is known as the "marriage-saver."
But most importantly, what they have done in Japan, which I find so inspirational, is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.
They've made it conversational.
People go out and upgrade their toilet.
They talk about it. They've sanitized it.
I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.
All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.
And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.
Our sewers are crumbling.
Things are going wrong here too.
The solution to all of this is pretty easy.
I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing, and that's to go out, protest, speak about the unspeakable, and talk shit.
Thank you.

<title>Frank Gehry: My days as a young rebel</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Before he was a legend, architect Frank Gehry takes a whistlestop tour of his early work, from his house in Venice Beach to the American Center in Paris, which was under construction when he gave this talk.</description>
I'm going to go right into the slides.
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff.
And my ideas are -- in my head, anyway -- they're very logical and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems, or I really do solve their problems, because usually they seem to like it.
Let me go right into the slides.
Can you turn off the light? Down.
I like to be in the dark.
I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here.
Anyway, I did this house in Santa Monica, and it got a lot of notoriety.
In fact, it appeared in a porno comic book, which is the slide on the right.
This is in Venice.
I just show it because I want you to know I'm concerned about context.
On the left-hand side, I had the context of those little houses, and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird, and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they're photographed or seen in that space.
And then, once I deal with the context, I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene, as I hope you'll find that slide on the right.
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
And we continue to work with this client.
The building on the right at the top is now under construction.
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down, finally, and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we've created, this campus.
And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
They wanted a sense of place.
And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.
And it was my theory, or my point of view, that one didn't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations.
I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood, whether they were buildings I liked or not.
In the '60s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.
We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.
And the success of it threw me for a loop.
I couldn't deal with the success of furniture -- I wasn't secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.
So, nobody would like this.
And it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture, that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.
And after we failed, I just kept failing.
The piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket.
And I put a piece of tape around it, as you see there, and realized you could sit on it, and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.
So, it was an accidental discovery.
I got into fish.
I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man, and if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.
And so I started making these funny things.
And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the Walker.
And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement.
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental, again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it, and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.
I did this building in Japan.
I was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed.
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.
And after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sketches on napkins.
And I made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.
And the client said, "Why no fish?"
And so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.
Three weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition.
Now, it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form, because they're so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this.
And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while, told me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.
But he was right -- I couldn't do the tail.
I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.
It was pretty hard.
The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.
And I put them together, and you walk between them.
It was a dialog with the context again.
Now, if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record -- they didn't show the context, so you would think, "God, what a pushy guy this is."
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant.
Couldn't find it.
So ...
As for craft and technology and all those things that you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.
This was built in six months.
The way we sent drawings to Japan: we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models, and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.
And when I got there, everything was perfect -- except the tail.
So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.
And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.
And then Jay Chiat, a friend and client, asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.
For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.
Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.
And so we built a temporary building -- I'm getting good at temporary -- and we put a conference room in that's a fish.
And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.
And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home, putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.
I played with it in the evening.
When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.
And the next night, we had gefilte fish.
And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices and I made a pedestal for a sculpture.
And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's, and I put the fish in.
It was a joke.
I play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.
We've been friends for a long time.
And we've started to work on things.
A few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy, called "Il Corso del Coltello" -- the Swiss Army knife.
And most of the imagery is -- Claes', but those two little boys are my sons, and they were Claes' assistants in the play.
He was the Swiss Army knife.
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter, and I was Frankie P. Toronto.
P for Palladio.
Dressed up like the AT&amp;T building by Claes -- with a fish hat.
The highlight of the performance was at the end.
This beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife, which I get credit for participating in.
And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg.
I had nothing to do with it.
The only thing I did was, I made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal, because I love sailing.
We made it into a sailing craft.
I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing.
I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture, when things are made in such great quantities, absorbed in such great quantities, and there's so much denial about them.
People hate it.
And I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture -- it's one of those materials.
And I'm always drawn to that.
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link, which nobody will forgive me for.
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.
And that chain link is really expensive.
It's in perspective and everything.
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer.
And you can see, we started making a building together.
Of course, the milk can is his.
But we were trying to collide our ideas, to put objects next to each other.
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life.
And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together.
Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing, and you entered in the middle.
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.
And he pushed that.
And one day I had a -- oh, well, the other way.
I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there, and I could never get rid of them after that.
Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal.
It made my building look sick.
And it was this interaction between that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.
It led to the building on the left.
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know, leaving out the -- what the hell.
I use a lot of metal in my work, and I have a hard time connecting with the craft.
The whole thing about my house, the whole use of rough carpentry and everything, was the frustration with the crafts available.
I said, "If I can't get the craft that I want, I'll use the craft I can get."
There were plenty of models for that, in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture.
And it was all of one material, and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.
The metalworkers, for the most part, do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington, and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.
And it's working very well to have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.
I just tell the stories.
It's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture.
The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller, in Sacramento.
And it's just a complex of factory buildings.
And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place -- a people place.
I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say, but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come and where the people working would interact.
So it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.
It's copper and galvanize.
I used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge, so it would buckle.
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.
Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect, and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.
And they end up looking like stone.
This is the central area.
There's a ramp.
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job.
And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning, asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.
Because these were ideas that we were talking about, building things next to each other, making -- it's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.
And so Stanley did the little dome thing.
And we did it over the phone and by fax.
He would send me a fax and show me something.
He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.
I told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.
I don't want the tower."
So he came back with a simpler building, but he put some funny details on it, and he moved it closer to my building.
And so I decided to put him in a depression.
I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax, going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.
And so then I put this big billboard behind it.
And I call it, "David and Goliath."
And that's my cafeteria.
In Boston, we had that old building on the left.
It was a very prominent building off the freeway, and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood, which had these cornices, projecting cornices.
Mine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper, which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.
Instead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.
We redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved, because they have very strict kind of design guideline, and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building.
In Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival, I did the Hollywood sign going and coming, made a building out of it, and they built it.
I flew in one night and took this picture.
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica -- a little shopping center.
And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa, in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.
It's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.
And the shape fit perfectly.
I just joined the points.
In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that I seized, because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.
This is a small house somewhere.
They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.
It's in the West Valley.
And we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake.
These are the models.
The reality, with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad.
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.
When you have to do something really cheaply, it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right.
It's kind of like a whole built town.
I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale.
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.
This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it.
He was too busy.
He didn't recommend me, by the way.
We ended up having to make it a sculpture, because the dilemma was, how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?
Etc. etc.
You've got the idea.
And so we finally ended up making it.
These people are art collectors.
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply -- it's that formed lumber from Finland.
We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
I keep trying to make it work.
In this case we learned how to detail it.
In Cleveland, there's Burnham Mall, on the left.
It's never been finished.
Going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.
There's a railroad track.
This is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.
And the centerline of the mall goes out.
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built, and so we followed.
Sohio is on the axis here, and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.
And this is our building, which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.
We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.
The health club is fastened to the garage with a C-clamp, for Cleveland.
You drive down.
So it's about a 10-story C-clamp.
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum, and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.
And this would be a hotel.
So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it, and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.
It's hard to do high-rise.
I feel much more comfortable down here.
This is a piece of property in Brentwood.
And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house -- I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left.
And she came back, I guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site.
And following that basic idea of the village, we changed it as we got into it.
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom, which I designed like a kind of a barge, looking like a boat.
And that's it, built.
The dome was a request from the client.
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.
She didn't care where.
When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope -- I mean, I haven't slept in it yet.
I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there, but she said I didn't have to do that.
But when you're in that room, you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.
And it's very private.
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.
And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room, and one on the other side.
These aren't focused very well.
I don't know how to do it from here.
Focus the one on the right.
It's up there.
Left -- it's my right.
Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.
That's the living room.
Servants' quarters.
A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.
And then you enter into the living room and then so on.
This is the bedroom.
You come down from this level along the stairway, and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.
And the bed is back in this space, with windows looking out onto the lake.
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.
The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it.
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis with the dining room table.
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.
But the idea is, the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside.
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private.
And you feel like you're in your own kind of village.
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney.
We're doing some work for him.
And this is in Anaheim, California, and it's a freeway building.
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour, and there's another bridge here.
And you're through this room in a split second, and the building will sort of reflect that.
On the backside, it's much more humane -- entrance, dining hall, etc.
And then this thing here -- I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.
Kind of a fun thing to do.
I'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel, which is an office building for a furniture company.
And we struggled with the image.
These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy, then people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing, but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building."
So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here, and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.
And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces.
This is in Paris, along the Seine.
Palais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.
There's a new library across the river.
And back in here, in this already treed park, we're doing a very dense building called the American Center, which has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum, restaurants and all kinds of -- it's a very dense program -- bookstores, etc.
In a very tight, small -- this is the ground level.
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.
They call it the plan coupe.
And I struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner.
These are the models for it.
I showed you the other model, the one -- this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing -- so I understood the problem.
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it?
Apartments, etc.
And these are the kind of study models we did.
And the one on the left is pretty awful.
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.
But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece worked frontally to this, parallel to this street, and also parallel to here.
And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt, kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater, etc.
So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone, except for this metal piece.
And it faces into a park.
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.
On the side facing the street it's much more normal, except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point, these housing units made a gesture to the corner.
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.
If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.
I don't know what to do.
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons.
And it's got a fish.
And I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish."
It's like a drug addict.
I say, "I'm not going to do it anymore -- I don't want to do it anymore -- I'm not going to do it."
And then I do it.
There it is.
But it's the living room.
And this piece here is -- I don't know what it is.
I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out.
This is Euro Disney, and I've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier.
We've had a lot of fun working together.
I think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me, but somehow we all manage to work together, and I think, productively.
So far.
This is a shopping thing.
You come into the Magic Kingdom and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall, with a rodeo and restaurants.
And another restaurant.
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull, I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station, to the route of the train.
It looks like it's kind of been there, and then crashed all these simpler forms into it.
The light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling.
In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel, we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.
And I tried to -- there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here, there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here -- I tried to make a relationship urbanistically.
And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.
And as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.
It's plaster and just zinc.
And you wonder, if this is a museum, what it's going to be like inside?
If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything, and just wait.
I'm so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful.
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.
It's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff.
And from the building in the back, you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills.
I know I'm over time.
See, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.
So it's pretty quiet inside.
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall.
It's a complicated project.
It has a chamber hall.
It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring.
And it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically, that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us.
And the plan of this -- it's a concert hall.
This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.
There's commercial at the ground floor.
These are offices, which, really, in the competition, we didn't have to design.
But finally, there's a hotel there.
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler, composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA, etc.
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria, which led to this compartmentalized scheme, which we found out after the competition would not work at all.
But everybody liked these forms and liked the space, and so that's one of the problems of a competition.
You have to then try and get that back in some way.
And we studied many models.
This was our original model.
These were the three buildings that were the ideal -- the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.
Everybody liked the surround.
Actually, this is the smallest hall in size, and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies.
Our client doesn't want balconies, so -- and when we met our new acoustician, he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape.
And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.
We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't, but now we have them.
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.
That's the idea.
And the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural.
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit, and create intimacy.
Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being -- and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.
We studied the acoustics with laser stuff, and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.
But you get the sense of the hall in section.
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.
In this case we're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners.
And so it will be quite a different shape.
The original building, because it was frog-like, fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.
When you get into a box, it's harder to do it -- and here we are, struggling with how to put the hotel in.
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.
I just stuck it on there.
But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away.
And of course it's not going to look like that, but it is the crazy way I tend to work.
And then finally, in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower, the highest building in L.A.
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs.
And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake.
It's a public space, and I made it kind of a garden structure, and you can go in it.
It's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there, and it works much better than a fish.
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that, at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel, non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it, perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front, and this is really a shopping center with department stores.
And we split these bridges.
Originally, this was all solid with a hole in it.
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel.
We showed this to the hotel people the other day, and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.
And finally, I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger.
I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here, but this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.
A little studio -- and it's sadly for sale.
Time goes on.
And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.
He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves, and I did the rest of it.
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.
It should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first.
It didn't work.
Thank you very much.

<title>Nicholas Negroponte: Taking OLPC to Colombia</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: TED follows Nicholas Negroponte to Colombia as he delivers laptops inside territory once controlled by guerrillas. His partner? Colombia's Defense Department, who see One Laptop per Child as an investment in the region. </description>
It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say, "What is your most precious natural resource?" -- they will not say children at first.
And then when you say children, they will pretty quickly agree with you.
: We're traveling today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia, head of the army and the head of the police, and we're dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television, no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years.
The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC, the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement.
There are one billion children in the world, and 50 percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school.
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.
And I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go.
So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype, it's gone from an idea to a real laptop.
We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children.
We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children, and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment.
So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.
That's smaller than I predicted -- I predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number.
In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.
It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working, not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off, in which the people who had been causing, if you will, 40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived.
And suddenly, the kids have connected laptops.
They've leapfrogged.
The change is absolutely monumental, because it's not just opening it up, but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.
So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone, yes, there will be television.
But the kids six to 12 years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages, so the children grow up with access to information, with a window into the rest of the world.
Before, they were closed off.
Interestingly enough, in other countries, it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth.
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year, but it's an important, deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children.
Thirty-one countries in total are involved, and in the case of Uruguay, half the children already have them, and by the middle of 2009, every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop.
Now what are some of the results?
Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much, and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.
Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents.
They own the laptops. They take them home.
And so when I met with three children from the schools, who had traveled all day to come to Bogota, one of the three children brought her mother.
And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write.
Her mother had not gone to primary school.
And this is such an inversion, and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change.
So now, in closing, people say, now why laptops?
Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.
The reason you want laptops is that the word is education, not laptop.
This is an education project, not a laptop project.
They need to learn learning. And then, just think -- they can have, let's say, 100 books.
In a village, you have 100 laptops, each with a different set of 100 books, and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.
You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.
Sometimes school is under a tree, or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education, so you need a collaborative model of learning, not just building more schools and training more teachers, which you have to do anyway.
So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."
Last year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program, and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free.
And by being a zero-dollar laptop, we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.
And that's what we did. We went to Haiti, we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mongolia.
Places that are not markets, seeding it with the principles of saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.
And then we can actually roll out large numbers.
So think of it this way: think of it as inoculating children against ignorance.
And think of the laptop as a vaccine.
You don't vaccinate a few children.
You vaccinate all the children in an area.

<title>Nate Silver: Does racism affect how you vote?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nate Silver has data that answers big questions about race in politics. For instance, in the 2008 presidential race, did Obama's skin color actually keep him from getting votes in some parts of the country? Stats and myths collide in this fascinating talk that ends with a remarkable insight.</description>
I want to talk about the election.
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African-American candidate for President.
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.
He won 375 electoral votes.
And he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate -- of any race, of any party -- in history.
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier -- Democrats really like seeing this transition here, where almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic -- even states Obama lost, like out west, those states became more blue.
In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there.
One exception is in Massachusetts.
That was John Kerry's home state.
No big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.
Or in Arizona, which is John McCain's home, Obama didn't have much improvement.
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.
Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton -- the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96, you see real big differences in this part of the country right here, the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it: 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did in 2008.
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.
So, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know.
There is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?"
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas.
He lost badly but every Democrat does.
He lost no worse than most people do.
But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?
And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.
And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country?
And the answer is: it is at least partially fair.
We know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people.
Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted exit polls in every state, in 37 states, out of the 50, they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.
They asked this question.
In deciding your vote for President today, was the race of the candidate a factor?
We're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor; moreover it was an important factor, in my decision," and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor, maybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.
We're looking for this behavior among white voters or, really, non-black voters.
So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question.
In Louisiana, about one in five white voters said, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American."
If those people had voted for Obama, even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.
Same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened" but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted, I suppose, manifestation of racially-based voting.
Here is the same data on a map.
You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said, "Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."
You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.
This really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country.
So we have to ask why.
Is racism predictable in some way?
Is there something driving this?
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand, and Kentucky?
Or are there more systematic factors at work?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.
These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time -- things like income, and religion, education.
Which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on November 4th?
And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships, one of which is education, where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red, and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region, is less educated. It's just a fact.
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns.
The other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in.
States that are more rural -- even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine -- they exhibit a little bit of this racially-based voting against Barack Obama.
So it's the combination of these two things: it's education and the type of neighbors that you have, which we'll talk about more in a moment.
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural, and they are educationally impoverished.
So yes, racism is predictable.
These things, among maybe other variables, but these things seem to predict it.
We're going to drill down a little bit more now, into something called the General Social Survey.
This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year.
And they ask a series of really interesting questions.
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes.
One simple question they asked is, "Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?"
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.
In cites, about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race, but in rural communities, only about 30 percent.
Probably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.
But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you.
So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or, really, some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors.
And we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.
This was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.
But you see Democrats versus Republican, not a big difference based on who your neighbors are.
And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action, which is kind of a political question, a policy question about race, if you will -- not much difference here.
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really.
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will, "Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"
There is a big difference.
People who don't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do.
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.
And likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996, "Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."
So it's really not even about urban versus rural.
It's about who you live with.
Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.
So if you want to address it, the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose, ideas for maybe how to do that.
I'm a big fan of cities.
Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable, and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking, the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.
But also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.
So we can think more about things like street grids.
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.
It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.
You have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.
And you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like, people you might not know.
And as a result it's a very tolerant community, which is different, I think, than something like this, which is in Schaumburg, Illinois, where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.
I think that actually this type of urban design, which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s -- I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan.
But also here is another idea we have -- is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad.
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU, have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas, and vice versa. Do it at the high school level.
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.
But the point is, this is all good news, because when something is predictable, it is what I call designable.
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem, even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.
If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't, we can start to design solutions to it.
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.

<title>Denis Dutton: A Darwinian theory of beauty</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: TED collaborates with animator Andrew Park to illustrate Denis Dutton's provocative theory on beauty -- that art, music and other beautiful things, far from being simply "in the eye of the beholder," are a core part of human nature with deep evolutionary origins.</description>
Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart, which is beauty.
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics, actually, for a living.
I try to figure out intellectually, philosophically, psychologically, what the experience of beauty is, what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.
Now this is an extremely complicated subject, in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different.
I mean just think of the sheer variety -- a baby's face, Berlioz's "Harold in Italy," movies like "The Wizard of Oz" or the plays of Chekhov, a central California landscape, a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji, "Der Rosenkavalier," a stunning match-winning goal in a World Cup soccer match, Van Gogh's "Starry Night," a Jane Austen novel, Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.
This brief list includes human beings, natural landforms, works of art and skilled human actions.
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy.
I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have.
And we get it not from a philosopher of art, not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic.
No, this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding, and you know who I mean: Charles Darwin.
Of course, a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question, "What is beauty?"
It's in the eye of the beholder.
It's whatever moves you personally.
Or, as some people, especially academics prefer, beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder.
People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease.
Beethoven is adored in Japan.
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums, while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth.
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere.
There are many differences among the arts, but there are also universal, cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values.
How can we explain this universality?
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric, largely pleistocene environments, where we became fully human, but also by the social situations in which we evolved.
This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory.
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.
And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.
Now, I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty, with its emotional intensity and pleasure, belongs to our evolved human psychology.
The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.
Beauty is an adaptive effect, which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment.
As many of you will know, evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.
The first of these is natural selection -- that's random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.
Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions, such as the horrid smell of rotting meat, or fears, such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff.
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs.
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection, and it operates very differently.
The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this.
It did not evolve for natural survival.
In fact, it goes against natural survival.
No, the peacock's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens.
It's quite a familiar story.
It's women who actually push history forward.
Darwin himself, by the way, had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.
He actually used that word.
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind, we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination, even obsession, in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction.
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance, so to speak.
I mean, you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape.
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover.
So evolution's trick is to make them beautiful, to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure, the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes.
People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape, a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.
This landscape shows up today on calendars, on postcards, in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand.
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees.
The trees, by the way, are often preferred if they fork near the ground, that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix.
The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view, or evidence of water in a bluish distance, indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road, perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline, that extends into the distance, almost inviting you to follow it.
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful, even by people in countries that don't have it.
The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience.
But, someone might argue, that's natural beauty.
How about artistic beauty?
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?
No, I don't think it is.
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it.
It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet.
Chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old, along with a few small, realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period.
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that.
Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair, as well as ochre body paint, have been found from around 100,000 years ago.
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this.
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes.
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.
These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries, until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single, thin stone blades, sometimes rounded ovals, but often in what are to our eyes an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form.
These Acheulian hand axes -- they're named after St. Acheul in France, where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands, scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa, almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed.
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals.
And the plot really thickens when you realize that, unlike other pleistocene tools, the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges.
And some, in any event, are too big to use for butchery.
Their symmetry, their attractive materials and, above all, their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes, even today.
So what were these ancient -- I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar.
What were these artifacts for?
The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art, practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects, contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship.
Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history -- tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" -- that is to say, displays that are performances like the peacock's tail, except that, unlike hair and feathers, the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted.
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence, fine motor control, planning ability, conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials.
Over tens of thousands of generations, such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable.
You know, it's an old line, but it has been shown to work -- "Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"
Except, of course, what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed, because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language.
It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact.
This object was made by a hominid ancestor, Homo erectus or Homo ergaster, between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language.
Stretching over a million years, the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history.
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens -- as they were then called, finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by, who knows, telling jokes, storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.
For us moderns, virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies, to express intense emotions with music, painting and dance.
But still, one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings: the beauty we find in skilled performances.
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall, human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts.
We find beauty in something done well.
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone, don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.
Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it, even before they could put their love into words.
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?
No, it's deep in our minds.
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors.
Our powerful reaction to images, to the expression of emotion in art, to the beauty of music, to the night sky, will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists.
Thank you.

<title>Lawrence Lessig: We the People, and the Republic we must reclaim</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: There is a corruption at the heart of American politics, caused by the dependence of Congressional candidates on funding from the tiniest percentage of citizens. That's the argument at the core of this blistering talk by legal scholar Lawrence Lessig. With rapid-fire visuals, he shows how the funding process weakens the Republic in the most fundamental way, and issues a rallying bipartisan cry that will resonate with many in the U.S. and beyond.</description>
Once upon a time, there was a place called Lesterland.
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.
Like the United States, it has about 311 million people, and of that 311 million people, it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.
If Matt's in the audience, I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second, this character from your series.
So 144,000 are called Lester, which means about .05 percent is named Lester.
Now, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.
One is called the general election.
The other is called the Lester election.
And in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote, but in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.
And here's the trick.
In order to run in the general election, you must do extremely well in the Lester election.
You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.
Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?
as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United, that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials, because, after all, there is a general election, but only after the Lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters is going to produce a subtle, understated, we could say camouflaged, bending to keep the Lesters happy.
Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt, but it's dependent upon the Lesters and dependent upon the people.
It has competing dependencies, we could say conflicting dependencies, depending upon who the Lesters are.
Okay. That's Lesterland.
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.
Number one, the United States is Lesterland.
The United States is Lesterland.
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections, one we called the general election, the second we should call the money election.
In the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote, if you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.
In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote, the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland, the trick is, to run in the general election, you must do extremely well in the money election.
You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.
But you must do extremely well.
And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.
Now you say, really?
Really .05 percent?
Well, here are the numbers from 2010: .26 percent of America gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate, .05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate, .01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent -- gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates, and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic is .000042 percent — for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans — gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending.
So I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers, and I say it's fair for me to say it's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.
In this sense, the funders are our Lesters.
Now, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?
Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United, we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials. We have a general election, but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election.
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy.
Candidates for Congress and members of Congress spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time raising money to get back to Congress or to get their party back into power, and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them, these humans, as they spend their time behind the telephone, calling people they've never met, but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?
As anyone would, as they do this, they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.
They become, in the words of "The X-Files," shape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money, not on issues one to 10, but on issues 11 to 1,000.
Leslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia, describes that when she went to Congress, she was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green."
Then to clarify, she went on, "He was not an environmentalist."
So here too we have a democracy, a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people, competing dependencies, possibly conflicting dependencies depending upon who the funders are.
Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.
Here's point number two.
The United States is worse than Lesterland, worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said, "Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election," we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.
You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.
There are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters, not many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.
We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think, "What could we do to make Lesterland better?"
It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.
But in our land, in this land, in USA-land, there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there, many of them in this room here today, but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters, because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent are not comprising it for the public interest.
It's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland.
And finally, point number three: Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland, against the background of its history, its traditions, in our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption, a corruption.
Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress.
I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.
I don't mean any criminal act.
The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.
It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.
The framers gave us what they called a republic, but by a republic they meant a representative democracy, and by a representative democracy, they meant a government, as Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone.
So here's the model of government.
They have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency, but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence, no longer a dependence upon the people alone, increasingly a dependence upon the funders.
Now this is a dependence too, but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people.
This is a corruption.
Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.
One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan, equal-opportunity corruption.
It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.
It blocks the right too, as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.
So the right wants smaller government.
When Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.
The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill, and as he reported back to me, the response was, "Hell no!
If we deregulate these guys, how are we going to raise money from them?"
This is a system that's designed to save the status quo, including the status quo of big and invasive government.
It works against the left and the right, and that, you might say, is good news.
But here's the bad news.
It's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption, because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election, that means the tiniest number of us, the tiniest, tiniest number of us, can block reform.
I know that should have been, like, a rock or something.
I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.
Block reform.
Because there is an economy here, an economy of influence, an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization.
It feeds on dysfunction.
The worse that it is for us, the better that it is for this fundraising.
Henry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."
This is the root.
Okay, now, every single one of you knows this.
You couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.
You ignore it. This is an impossible problem.
You focus on the possible problems, like eradicating polio from the world, or taking an image of every single street across the globe, or building the first real universal translator, or building a fusion factory in your garage.
These are the manageable problems, so you ignore — — so you ignore this corruption.
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.
We need a government that works.
And not works for the left or the right, but works for the left and the right, the citizens of the left and right, because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption.
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality.
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you, look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.
There will never be a Christmas.
We will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first.
So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.
Yours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue, the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about.
No sensible reform, and we cannot afford a world, a future, with no sensible reform.
Okay. So how do we do it?
Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.
If the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America, the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans, to spread it out, to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone.
And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment, changing the First Amendment.
To do this would require a single statute, a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections, a statute of citizen-funded campaigns, and there's any number of these proposals out there: Fair Elections Now Act, the American Anti-Corruption Act, an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project to give vouchers to people to fund elections, an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.
Each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.
The analytics are easy here.
It's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard, because this reform would shrink K Street, and Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, put it, has become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.
Members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head, a business model focused on their life after government, their life as lobbyists.
Fifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004 left to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.
Those numbers have only gone up, and as United Republic calculated last April, the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was 1,452 percent.
So it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?
Now I get this skepticism.
I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.
But I don't buy it.
This is a solvable issue.
If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the 20th century, issues like racism, or sexism, or the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia, those are hard issues.
You don't wake up one day no longer a racist.
It takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA, out of the soul of a people.
But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.
Change the incentives, and the behavior changes, and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice.
When Connecticut adopted this system, in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only.
It's solvable, not by being a Democrat, not by being a Republican.
It's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens, by being TEDizens.
Because if you want to kickstart reform, look, I could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy, I could give you back a republic.
Okay. But even if you're not yet with me, even if you believe this is impossible, what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me as I've spoken about this issue again and again is, even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.
Irrelevant.
I spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke, I write in my book, and she said to me, "Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless.
There's nothing we can do."
When she said that, I scrambled.
I tried to think, "How do I respond to that hopelessness?
What is that sense of hopelessness?"
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.
And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying, "Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do.
Nothing you can do."
So would I do nothing?
Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?
I'm going off to build Google Glass.
Of course not. I would do everything I could, and I would do everything I could because this is what love means, that the odds are irrelevant and that you do whatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.
And then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals love this country.
And so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible, what this love of country says back is, "That's just irrelevant."
We lose something dear, something everyone in this room loves and cherishes, if we lose this republic, and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong.
So here's my question: Do you have that love?
Do you have that love?
Because if you do, then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said, "Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"
Franklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."
A republic. A representative democracy.
A government dependent upon the people alone.
We have lost that republic.
All of us have to act to get it back.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

<title>Martin Rees: Is this our final century?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Speaking as both an astronomer and "a concerned member of the human race," Sir Martin Rees examines our planet and its future from a cosmic perspective. He urges action to prevent dark consequences from our scientific and technological development.</description>
If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common: their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.
My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race.
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning, to set our Earth in a cosmic context.
And let me just run through a few slides.
This was the impact that happened last week on a comet.
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday.
So that's another project for NASA.
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.
That looks like a coastline.
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane -- the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.
If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.
And we can see places where stars are forming, like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.
In six billion years, the sun will look like that.
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion, leaving remnants like that.
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.
And to the cosmologist, these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.
This picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky.
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda, which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron, the building blocks of planets and of life.
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang -- a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos?
I'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time, which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom, you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.
And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe.
And we compare simulated universes like that -- I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky.
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang, but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.
That's a challenge for 21st-century science.
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.
We know our universes are united though -- links between left and right.
The everyday world is determined by atoms, how they stick together to make molecules.
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter: particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
The micro-world of the quantum is understood.
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.
But the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically at the top of that picture.
And until we have that synthesis, we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom, quantum effects could shake everything.
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small, which we don't yet have.
One idea, incidentally -- and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on -- is that our Big Bang was not the only one.
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.
You can imagine ants on one of them thinking it's a two-dimensional universe, not being aware of another population of ants on the other.
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours, but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension, and we're imprisoned in our three.
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe -- the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.
Bottom right depicts our universe, which on the horizon is not beyond that, but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems, one galaxy to many galaxies, we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang, perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties.
Well, let's go back to this picture.
There's one challenge symbolized at the top, but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small, but we want to understand the very complex.
And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars.
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.
We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms, to have layer upon layer of complex structure.
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets -- otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us.
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms, within a factor of two of the mass of each person here.
Well, most of you anyway.
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all, greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right.
And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever.
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.
And I now move on to the second part of my talk, and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.
If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself, and I would add that it's available in paperback.
And in America it was called "Our Final Hour" because Americans like instant gratification.
But my theme is that in this century, not only has science changed the world faster than ever, but in new and different ways.
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence, perhaps even implants into our brains, may change human beings themselves. And human beings, their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.
It may change this century.
It's new in our history.
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming, mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects, while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.
But they will have a dark side.
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower just one fanatic, or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses, to trigger some kind on disaster.
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure -- error rather than terror.
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence.
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.
I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones.
And also, when a scientist makes a discovery, he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.
We have to accept that there will be hazards.
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era, post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb, in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers.
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein, who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein, the icon of poster and t-shirt, who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.
He was premature. But he was a moral compass -- an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.
And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.
Equally untidy office there, as you can see.
He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.
And I think to harness science optimally, to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed, we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.
We need not just campaigning physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists as well.
And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service, or company employees subject to commercial pressure.
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist, just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think, in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective, and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the American Bible Belt, anyway -- but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution, aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.
The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years, but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.
And it'll be another six billion before that happens, and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there, experiencing the sun's demise, but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond.
If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year, say from January when it was made to December, the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June -- a tiny fraction of the year.
But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective, our century is very, very special, the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.
As I should have shown this earlier, it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
When Einstein died in 1955, one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post.
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image: the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds, contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints.
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.
What would they have seen?
Over nearly all that immense time, Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.
The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.
The continental landmasses drifted around.
Ice cover waxed and waned.
Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history, the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.
This signaled the start of agriculture.
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.
Then other things happened even more abruptly.
Within just 50 years -- that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age -- the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise, and ominously fast.
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves -- the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions. And something else happened.
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the Earth.
Some journeyed to the moons and planets.
A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth's life?
These human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?
If they continued their vigil, what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years?
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
Or will the biosphere stabilize?
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?
The science done by the young Einstein will continue as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive, we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein -- humane, global and farseeing.
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth, far beyond the Earth as depicted here.
Thank you very much.

<title>Gary Greenberg: The beautiful nano details of our world</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When photographed under a 3D microscope, grains of sand appear like colorful pieces of candy and the stamens in a flower become like fantastical spires at an amusement park. Gary Greenberg reveals the thrilling details of the micro world.</description>
So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view, and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.
I've found, after doing this for many, many years, that there's a magical world behind reality.
And that can be seen directly through a microscope, and I'm going to show you some of this today.
So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small, something that we can see with our naked eye, and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee, it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.
But to really see the details of the bee, and really appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.
So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope, and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia, and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they're right up close to something, because they can't see in stereo.
As we go smaller, here is a human hair.
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.
It's about a tenth of a millimeter.
And as we go smaller again, about ten times smaller than that, is a cell.
So you could fit 10 human cells across the diameter of a human hair.
So when we would look at cells, this is how I really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope.
When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system, they're actually moving all over the place.
This cell is looking for foreign objects, bacteria, things that it can find.
And it's looking around, and when it finds something, and recognizes it being foreign, it will actually engulf it and eat it.
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium, and it engulfs it and eats it.
If you take some heart cells from an animal, and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.
That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life, and these cells, the mission is to move blood around our body.
These next cells are nerve cells, and right now, as we see and understand what we're looking at, our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now. They're not just static. They're moving around making new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.
As you go farther down this scale here, that's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
That's how small that is.
And microscopes that we have today can actually see individual atoms. So these are some pictures of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.
This is a ring of cobalt atoms.
So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here is called the nano world, and the nano world, the whole micro world that we see, there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.
But I want to talk about this larger world, the world of the micro world.
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower, what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here, and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.
The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here, this is the style of that flower, and you notice that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land.
It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.
These are little bits of individual grain of pollen there and there, and here is a -- what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen, when you look in a microscope, it's actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen.
So this, for example, when you see bees flying around these little plants, and they're collecting pollen, those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive, and that's what makes the beehive, the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar, and that's what makes the honey that we eat.
Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision, with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.
There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen.
So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there, and there's the pistil there, and these are the little things called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give a fragrance, and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances.
I want to talk about something really ordinary, just ordinary sand.
I became interested in sand about 10 years ago, when I first saw sand from Maui, and in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
But when you look closer at this, look at what's there.
It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.
You have things like coral.
You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.
You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit of a volcano there. You have tube worms.
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.
And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island, a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow, and when they die, their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand, things like coral and so forth.
So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.
This is from Lahaina, and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.
We don't realize it, but it's actually a record of that entire ecology.
So here we see, for example, a sponge spicule, two bits of coral here, that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.
So when I first looked at this, I was -- I thought, gee, this is like a little treasure trove here.
I couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them.
Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like.
These are quartz crystals and feldspar, so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock.
So mountains are built up, and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth, and they become grains of sand.
There's some sand that's really much more colorful.
These are sand from near the Great Lakes, and you can see that it's filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff, and if you look at different sands from different places, every single beach, every single place you look at sand, it's different. Here's from Big Sur, like they're little jewels.
There are places in Africa where they do the mining of jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean, and it's like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope.
So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.
Every single grain is different. There are no two grains of sand alike in the world.
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.
They're like a snapshot in time.
Now sand is not only on Earth, but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space is filled with sand, and that sand comes together to make our planets and the Moon.
And you can see those in micrometeorites.
This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me, and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.
And they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in -- the planets and the Moon.
So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand, so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.
This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.
I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.
Now, the way my microscopes work is, normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time, so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope, keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like, and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see, is a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.
So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.
Now something's interesting here. This looks very different than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me.
Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now, because for four billion years it's been bombarded by micrometeorites, and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.
And you can see here that that is -- that's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together.
This is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.
And that's called a ring agglutinate.
And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that, and you'd never find that on Earth.
Most of the sand on the Moon, especially -- and you know when you look at the Moon, there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows, and that's what this sand looks like, very similar to the sand that you would see in Haleakala.
Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in, they vaporize and they make these fountains, these microscopic fountains that go up into the -- I was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air -- goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the Moon, they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.
And these are actually microscopic; you need a microscope to see these.
Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon, and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there.
This grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old, and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling, air, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the Sun, has these solar storms, and that's erosion by solar radiation.
So what I've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view.
I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said, "To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour."
Thank you.

<title>Edith Widder: The weird, wonderful world of bioluminescence</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the deep, dark ocean, many sea creatures make their own light for hunting, mating and self-defense. Bioluminescence expert Edith Widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world. At TED2011, she brings some of her glowing friends onstage, and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life.</description>
So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world.
And it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel, but it's to a place where it's defined by light.
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light.
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs.
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution.
But mostly I'm entranced by it.
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible, when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays, I've been a bioluminescence junky.
But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words, and they were totally inadequate to the task.
I needed some way to share the experience directly.
And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called Deep Rover.
This next video clip, you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.
And the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across.
Narrator: In front of the sub, a mess screen will come into contact with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.
With the sub's lights switched off, it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh.
This is the first time it has ever been recorded.
Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye.
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible.
But just to try to prove that fact to you, I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration.
So, if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible, I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it.
And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now, either because they're dead -- or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.
Oops. Sorry.
I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.
Okay.
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate, a single-celled alga.
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light?
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.
The flash is like a scream for help.
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder, thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away.
There's a lot of animals that use this trick, for example this black dragonfish.
It's got a light organ under its eye.
It's got a chin barbel.
It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime, because the top speed of this fish is one knot, which was the top speed of the submersible.
But it was worth it, because we caught it in a special capture device, brought it up into the lab on the ship, and then everything on this fish lights up.
It's unbelievable.
The light organs under the eyes are flashing.
That chin barbel is flashing.
It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing, fin lights.
It's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.
It's phenomenal.
And you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light.
For example, this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.
This blinds or distracts the predator.
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this.
Now it may look like a tasty morsel, or a pig's head with wings -- but if it's attacked, it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing.
It's phenomenal.
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light.
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators.
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean, that's where things get really strange.
And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar," but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.
They're things like this.
This is a golden coral, a bush.
It grows very slowly.
In fact, it's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old, which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.
The other reason is this amazing bush glows.
So if you brush up against it, any place you brushed against it, you get this twinkling blue-green light that's just breathtaking.
And you see things like this.
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing.
And these are flytrap anemones.
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.
But if you keep poking it, it starts to produce light.
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.
It produces these strings of light, presumably as some form of defense.
There are starfish that can make light.
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms.
This looks like a plant, but it's actually an animal.
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents, as you see here.
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock, it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume, changing color as it goes, from green to blue.
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure.
But we have no idea why it does that.
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.
It's a green saber of light.
And like the one you just saw, it can produce these as bands of light.
So if I squeeze the base, the bands go from base to tip.
If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?
I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about.
So there's a language of light in the deep ocean, and we're just beginning to understand it, and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays.
This is an optical lure that I've used.
We call it the electronic jellyfish.
It's just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays.
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals, so it's unobtrusive.
So I just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea.
So the camera's black and white.
It's not high-resolution.
And what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean -- there are isopods all over it.
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish.
And when it starts flashing, it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.
But as soon as it starts to flash -- and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera -- I want you to look right here.
There's something small there that responds.
We're talking to something.
It looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact, three strings of pearls.
And this was very consistent.
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.
We basically have a chat room going on here, because once it gets started, everybody's talking.
And I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it.
We don't know what we're saying.
Personally, I think it's something sexy.
And then finally, I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam, which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.
We've only just begun to analyze all of this data.
This is going to be a glowing source first, which is like bioluminescent bacteria.
And it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.
So this scavenger comes in, which is a giant sixgill shark.
And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.
But if it had been following the odor plume, it would have come in from the other direction.
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish.
That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam, and it's going to be this pinwheel display.
And this is a burglar alarm.
And that was a Humboldt squid, a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.
But if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.
It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.
But we did see a bunch of responses like this.
This guy is a little more contemplative.
"Hey, wait a minute.
There's supposed to be something else there."
He's thinking about it.
But he's persistent.
He keeps coming back.
And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more, and thinks, "Maybe if I come in from a different angle."
Nope.
So we are starting to get a handle on this, but only just the beginnings.
We need more eyes on the process.
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible, by all means, climb in and take the plunge.
This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list, because we live on an ocean planet.
More than 90 percent, 99 percent, of the living space on our planet is ocean.
It's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures, alien life forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see.
But if you do take the plunge, please remember to turn out the lights.
But I warn you, it's addictive.
Thank you.

<title>Nick Bostrom: A philosophical quest for our biggest problems</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Oxford philosopher and transhumanist Nick Bostrom examines the future of humankind and asks whether we might alter the fundamental nature of humanity to solve our most intrinsic problems.</description>
I want to talk today about -- I've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view.
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging.
It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important.
The first is -- death is a big problem.
If you look at the statistics, the odds are not very favorable to us.
So far, most people who have lived have also died.
Roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now.
So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 -- sorry, the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day, which is a huge number by any standard.
The annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million.
If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada.
Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.
Can't see it because it's too big.
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem.
Once you think about it, you see this is not statistical points; these are -- let's see, how far have I talked?
I've talked for three minutes.
So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.
People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died.
Now, the human cost of that is obvious, once you start to think about it -- the suffering, the loss -- it's also, economically, enormously wasteful.
I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular.
Suppose we approximated one person with one book?
Now, of course, this is an underestimation.
A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book.
But let's suppose we did this.
52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds, then, to 52 million volumes destroyed.
Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes.
We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria.
It's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember, even today.
But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress -- burnt down, forever lost -- each year.
So that's the first big problem.
And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey, and other people like him, to try to do something about this as soon as possible.
Existential risk -- the second big problem.
Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.
Now, why do I say that this is a big problem?
Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising.
You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area.
But there have been four studies -- one by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century: 50 percent.
Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday, also has a 50 percent probability estimate.
Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate, but says the probability is significant that it will fail.
I wrote a long paper on this.
I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have.
Now, the exact figures here, we should take with a big grain of salt, but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial.
Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.
Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation.
Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million.
So that's a large number.
If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up, then the figure becomes astronomical.
If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe -- the Virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there, but if we go extinct we never will.
Then, even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32.
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority.
Now, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem, because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.
Think about some time in your life -- some people might never have experienced it -- but some people, there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic.
It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage.
Or when you understood something you had never done before.
Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love.
Or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.
Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.
And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?
You just want to cling onto this.
And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.
And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best.
Or how bad it can be at its worst.
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be.
I think that's a big, big problem.
It's easy to say what we don't want.
Here are a number of things that we don't want -- illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty, stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.
Suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these.
We were very successful.
We got rid of all of these things.
We might end up with something like this, which is -- I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that.
But is this really the best we can dream of?
Is this the best we can do?
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?
And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives.
On my wish list, at least, would be: much longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being, enhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding, unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits, better relationships, an unbounded potential for spiritual, moral and intellectual development.
If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?
And this is the answer -- we would have to change.
Not just the world around us, but we, ourselves.
Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are -- our very biology.
Human nature would have to change.
Now, when we think about changing human nature, the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery, stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants, anabolic steroids, artificial hearts.
It's a pretty pathetic list.
They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition, but for most people, they don't really transform what it is to be human.
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that, well, sure, there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people.
But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way.
It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.
We have skin enhancements, clothing.
As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing.
Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial -- caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement, vision enhancement, anesthetics -- we take that very much for granted, but just think about how great progress that is -- like, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.
Contraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques -- that sounds ominous, but the distinction between what is a technology -- a gadget would be the archetype -- and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle.
So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read, you're actually, literally rewriting your own brain.
You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.
So in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets, like these things here, but even institutions and techniques, psychological methods and so forth.
Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature.
Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.
We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are, but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc.
It's possible to assume, setting aside a possibility of catastrophe, that sooner or later we will develop all of these.
And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition.
So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement.
Health span is a big and urgent thing, because if you're not alive, then all the other things will be to little avail.
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box, which falls into a lot of different sub-categories: memory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy.
These are really great things.
Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people -- they're positional goods.
But part of the reason -- and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these -- is that they're also intrinsically valuable.
It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned.
Modalities and special faculties.
Now, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor, but it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules that do specific things for us.
If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning -- music, humor, eroticism, spirituality, aesthetics, nurturing and caring, gossip, chatting with people -- all of these, very likely, are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have, but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these.
We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.
All of these would enable, in principle -- be amenable to enhancement.
Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have.
It's also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values, why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be?
Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.
And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to.
But maybe they have another faculty, something else that would seem equally irrational to us, but they actually tap into some great possible value there.
But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value.
So we could think of adding on different, new sensory capacities and mental faculties.
Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control.
Greater subjective well-being.
Be able to switch between relaxation and activity -- being able to go slow when you need to do that, and to speed up.
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state, when you're totally immersed in something you are doing.
Conscientiousness and sympathy.
The ability to -- it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification, perhaps.
If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to.
That's probably not all that difficult.
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.
It's been done in voles.
You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous.
It's just a single gene.
Might be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much.
This is the last picture that I want to -- now we've got to use the laser pointer.
A possible mode of being here would be a way of life -- a way of being, experiencing, thinking, seeing, interacting with the world.
Down here in this little corner, here, we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings -- beings with our biological capacities.
It's a part of the space that's accessible to animals; since we are animals, we are a subset of that.
And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities.
There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are.
So then, you move off to this larger sphere of "human +," and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being.
Now, why is that a good thing to do?
Well, we know already that in this little human circle there, there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful.
We have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being, perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about.
And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there.
Thanks.

<title>Vusi Mahlasela: "Thula Mama"</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: South African singer-songwriter Vusi Mahlasela dedicates his song, "Thula Mama," to all women -- and especially his grandmother.</description>
I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.
And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother, whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles, especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.
You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor, as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans -- biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?
And the students wanted to speak to the government, and police answered with bullets.
So every year, June 16, we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died.
And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years, and I started asking questions, and that’s when my political education started.
And I joined, later on, the youth organization under the African National Congress.
So as part of organizing this and whatever, this commemoration, the police will round us up as they call us leaders.
And I used to run away from home, when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so.
And my grandmother one time said, "No, look, you’re not going to run away.
This is your place, you stay here."
And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.
So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house, and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house, and opened the kitchen door.
And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.
I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us, while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.
He is here, and you're not going to take him.
I've got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here, gets it."
And they left.

<title>Gary Lauder's new traffic sign: Take Turns</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Fifty percent of traffic accidents happen at intersections. Gary Lauder shares a brilliant and cheap idea for helping drivers move along smoothly: a new traffic sign that combines the properties of "Stop" and "Yield."</description>
I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking.
I've had some time to think it over.
And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle -- it's also about the road.
Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections, of which there are two types: signalized and unsignalized, which means stop signs.
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.
Roundabouts are much better.
A study of 24 intersections has found crashes drop 40 percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent, fatal crashes down 90 percent.
But that's just safety.
What about time and gas?
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking, which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution, less time wasted, and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States.
So, unsignalized intersections, meaning stop signs, they save many lives, but there's an excessive proliferation of them.
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.
This is one in my neighborhood. And they are much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.
They're expensive to install, but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.
But they are not applicable in all situations.
So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.
So, it's logical that you'd have one there, on the minor road entering the major.
But the other two are somewhat questionable.
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.
Cars rarely appear on that third road.
And so, the question is, what does that cost us?
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000 cars per day in each direction, and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day, that's $51,000 per year.
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution, wear on the car, and time.
What's that time worth?
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars, that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that sign in each direction.
Discount that back to the present, at five percent: over two million dollars for a stop sign, in each direction.
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth, you could actually buy the property, cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line, and then sell it off again.
And you'd still come out ahead.
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?
Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?
The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely.
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.
Can that be accomplished with existing signs?
So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.
Stop signs were invented in 1915, yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.
So, why not use a yield sign?
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.
That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating, or taking turns, and it's always on the minor road, allowing the major one to have primacy.
So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."
That would not work.
So, what the world needs now is a new type of sign.
So, you'd have a little instruction below it, you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.
It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.
And uncertainty results in caution.
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down.
So, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...
don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.
But you all are members of communities, and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows.
And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.

<title>Paul Rothemund: DNA folding, in detail</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 2007, Paul Rothemund gave TED a short summary of his specialty, DNA folding. Now he lays out in clear, abundant detail the immense promise of this field -- to create tiny machines that assemble themselves.</description>
So, people argue vigorously about the definition of life.
They ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.
And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.
I will say that life involves computation.
So this is a computer program.
Booted up in a cell, the program would execute, and it could result in this person; or with a small change, it could result in this person; or another small change, this person; or with a larger change, this dog, or this tree, or this whale.
So now, if you take this metaphor [of] genome as program seriously, you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson, Craig Venter, as are all of us.
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true, there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you.
But one, to me, that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output.
A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wing fly.
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
Or if you're familiar with "The Princess Bride," it could create a six-fingered man.
Now, a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.
If your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit, you could end up with a thousand dollars.
So these small changes are things that I think that -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified, large changes.
So now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology, and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does.
And what I want to do is write molecular programs, potentially to build technology.
And there are a lot of people doing this, a lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.
And they concentrate on using cells.
They're cell-oriented.
So my friends, molecular programmers, and I have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.
We're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein, and building new languages for building things from the bottom up, using biomolecules, potentially having nothing to do with biology.
So, these are all the machines in a cell.
There's a camera.
There's the solar panels of the cell, some switches that turn your genes on and off, the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.
My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.
We're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest, easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.
And as other things become easier to use -- maybe protein -- we'll work with those.
If we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?
You're going to sit in front of your computer.
You're going to design something like a cell phone, and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately, is it will do a developmental computation, a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.
And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already, I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers, building electronic computers, which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers, which will build new electronic computers, and so forth.
And if you buy all of this, and you think life is about computation, as I do, then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.
So one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?
And for molecular programming, the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing?
Or how does a computer program know when to stop running?
Or more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop?
There are other questions like this, too.
One of them is Craig Venter's question.
Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.
He asked, how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism?
How few genes can I use?
This is exactly analogous to the question, what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word?
And just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller, he's writing genomes that will work, we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does.
But for molecular programming, our question is, how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone?
What's the smallest number we can get away with?
Now, these are big questions in computer science.
These are all complexity questions, and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions.
Almost -- many of them are impossible.
But for some tasks, we can start to answer them.
So, I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.
So, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA.
It's double-stranded, it's a double helix, has the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.
And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes, just so I don't scare you.
We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.
When we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded, so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube, and they're floppy when they're single-stranded.
You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.
Now for the last 25 years, Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.
But a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.
They can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.
So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop.
But to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA, which is technically very difficult to get.
So, you can go to a natural source.
You can look in this computer-fabricated artifact, and he's got a double-stranded genome -- that's no good.
You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria.
They're no good either.
Double strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus that has a nice, long, single-stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper.
And here's how we do it.
This is part of that genome.
We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place, and a right half that binds it in a different place, and brings the long strand together like this.
The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle.
Now, we can't actually take a movie of this process, but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it.
And what happens is that we mix these strands together.
We heat them up, we add a little bit of salt, we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down, and as we cool them down, the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure.
And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.
When you look at DNA origami, you can see that what it really is, even though you think it's complicated, is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other, and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one.
So there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds -- it jumps to another helix and comes back.
That holds the long strand like this.
Now, to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted, I tried to make this shape.
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye, down the nose, up the nose, around the forehead, back down and end in a little loop like this.
And so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work.
So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.
I ordered them; they came by FedEx.
I mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down, and I got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water.
And each one of these is just one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?
So, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them, you have to get them on a surface where they stick.
So, you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface, and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.
It's got a needle, like a record needle, that goes back and forth over the surface, bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.
It feels the DNA origami.
There's the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough.
When you zoom in, they've got, you know, weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.
You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop, this little nano-goatee.
Now, what's great about this is anybody can do this.
And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.
Anyone know what this is? What is it?
It's China, right?
So, what happened is, a graduate student in China, Lulu Qian, did a great job.
She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami, a beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan, and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?
So, this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?
And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.
And what's really neat about it -- well, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork, but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits.
So, you can put circuit components on the staples, like a light bulb and a light switch.
Let the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.
And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.
So, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did.
They took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes, made a little switch, you see here, wired it up, tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.
Now, this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go.
But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size of those in a normal computer.
So it's very promising for making small computers.
Now, I want to get back to that compiler.
The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works.
So, you start with something in the computer.
You get a high-level description of the computer program, a high-level description of the origami.
You can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer, and it actually works.
And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly, and will allow us to do this in a nice, visual, computer-aided design way.
So, now you can say, all right, why isn't DNA origami the end of the story?
You have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.
The fact is that it does not scale.
So if you want to build a human from DNA origami, the problem is, you need a long strand that's 10 trillion trillion bases long.
That's three light years' worth of DNA, so we're not going to do this.
We're going to turn to another technology, called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
It was started by Erik Winfree, and what it does, it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.
You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles, if they match.
And we like to draw these tiles as little squares.
And if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits, you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.
So, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard.
And the point of this, if you didn't catch that, is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns.
And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs -- specifically, counting.
So, you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together, form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard.
So you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.
And in order to get these kinds of computations started right, you need some kind of input, a kind of seed.
You can use DNA origami for that.
You can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a DNA origami, and when you add those tiles that count, they will start to count -- they will read that 32 and they'll stop at 32.
So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going.
It knows when to stop growing because it can count.
It knows how big it is.
So, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.
It doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.
So now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise.
Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami, and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square.
The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing.
So, what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles.
And the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.
You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32.
And if you do that, the origami's the same size, but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.
So, this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development.
You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -- single, tiny, little mutations -- can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger.
Now, this -- using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.
So, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size?
If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square; so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.
That's really not affordable.
But if we use a little computation -- we use origami, plus some tiles that count -- then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands.
And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use, if we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation.
And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something, to reduce the size of the genome that you're building.
And finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers.
If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory.
So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles -- rather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles -- then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits, the demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.
So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation.
It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.
Now, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path?
Experimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.
Here is a DNA origami rectangle, and here are some tiles growing from it.
And you can see how they count.
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.
So it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.
So, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago, and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.
We've got ideas about how to fix these errors.
And I think in the next five or 10 years, we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.
So now, what do I want you to take away from this talk?
I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms, life uses computation to do that.
And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations, and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it, as Feynman said, you know, we need to build something to understand it.
And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing, rebuild everything from the bottom up, using DNA in ways that nature never intended, using DNA origami, and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.
You know, so this is all very cool, but what I'd like you to take from the talk, hopefully from some of those big questions, is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.
It's not just making about -- it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light, asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you.

<title>Maira Kalman: The illustrated woman</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Author and illustrator Maira Kalman talks about her life and work, from her covers for The New Yorker to her books for children and grown-ups. She is as wonderful, as wise and as deliciously off-kilter in person as she is on paper.</description>
What I am always thinking about is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.
And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded, but in the best sense of the word.
I'm trying to figure out two very simple things: how to live and how to die, period.
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.
And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks, and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things that keep you grounded.
So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.
My older sister was busy torturing my parents, and they were busy torturing her.
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored, which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.
So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.
And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967, where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.
And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end.
But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building, but he went to Cuba.
But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale so I had more money than he did.
And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.
But, then he came back, and things happened, and I decided I really hated my writing, that it was awful, awful, purple prose.
And I decided that I wanted to tell -- but I still wanted to tell a narrative story and I still wanted to tell my stories.
So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?
And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know, sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.
And we started a studio.
Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&amp;Co.
And the premise of M&amp;Co was, we don't know anything, but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.
And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything, because if you know too much, you're stymied.
So, the premise in the studio was, there are no boundaries, there is no fear.
And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth, was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas that -- fortunately, there were enough people there, and it was a team, it was a collective, it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.
But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.
And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&amp;Co, and clearly we also needed to make some money, so we decided we would create a series of products.
And some of the watches there, attempting to be beautiful and humorous -- maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.
That to be able to talk about content, to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise, elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.
It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say, the content is what's important, not the package, not the wrapping.
You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors, you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.
So, the good news is that I have a dog and, though I don't know if I believe in luck -- I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question, but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house, because everybody's always, you know, leaving, they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail, and he runs to the other room.
But I am able to make the transition from working for children and -- from working for adults to children, and back and forth, because, you know, I can say that I'm immature, and in a way, that's true.
I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand, I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.
But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.
And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.
So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension -- -- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.
So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new.
So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.
You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.
And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.
And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids and you're not talking in such a way that you, you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.
So, I hopefully am writing, you know, books that are good for children and for adults.
But the painting reflects -- I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.
I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy, the same kind of love of language.
So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.
This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said, "You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.
So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.
Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels, and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.
And the books are really journals of my life.
I never -- I don't like plots.
I don't know what a plot means.
I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning, you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me, because my life is too random and too confused, and I enjoy it that way.
But anyway, so we were in Venice, and this is our room. And I had this dream that I was wearing this fantastic green gown, and I was looking out the window, and it was really a beautiful thing.
And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet, and hopefully go on to something else.
The letter C had other things in it.
I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed, though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.
And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx, and somebody said Bronxistan, and somebody said Ferreristan, and we came up with this New Yorker cover, which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover, and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened, would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.
And it really became the -- I don't know, you know, it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.
And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know, for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know, we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?
Who are these people? What are these tribes?
And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it, had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers, because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.
But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?
They're not."
So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.
You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen and that's kind of the beauty part.
And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration, and I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.
And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school, because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out, and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.
I said, people should know about this book.
So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.
And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate, and what an intersection of like, you know, Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying, I'd like to do something to this book.
And they said yes, and they left me completely alone, which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.
And I took the examples that they gave, and just did 56 paintings, basically.
So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."
And when you're dealing with grammar, which is, you know, incredibly dry, E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk -- and then you come to the rules and, you know, there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?
Do you mind my asking a question?"
"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."
And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell, and "could" is an August Sander subject.
And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."
So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme that I really love very much.
And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules, which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do, or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.
So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing, because I really adore singing, and I think that music is the highest form of all art.
So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly, who wrote nine songs using the text, and we performed this fantastic evening of -- he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
I played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the New York Public Library, where you're supposed to be very, very quiet, and it was a phenomenally wonderful event, which we hopefully will do some more.
Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page, asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.
So, once a month for the last year, I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty," which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is, but I know I can throw that around now. You know, it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.
I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some, because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.
And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing, because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"
And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"
And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."
OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.
"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?
Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."
And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct, and then I talk about Spinoza.
"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything, called eudaemonia.
And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him, and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."
I happen to know it for a fact.
And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.
And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza, but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog, and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic, decrepit palace.
"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrived.
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs, but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."
You don't even know.
"And decided his top people had to be extinctified."
Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.
And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart, because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.
So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.
"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov, sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair, leafing through a book and butterflies, imagine such displacement, such loss?"
And then I want to tell you that this is a map.
So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.
Too many pogroms.
Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch, they went to Palestine and then America."
And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America, and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever.
Facts were actually banished from our home.
And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina, this is the home that I grew up in, OK?
So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.
But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.
But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin, which is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."
But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is "sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell," because she couldn't care less.
"The Impossibility of February" is that February's a really wretched month in New York and the images for me conjure up these really awful things.
Well, not so awful.
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead, just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow, but the caption says he is dead."
And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know, maybe he's not dead.
"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man, but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."
There's consoling.
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase, and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.
And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.
It is February and not lying is impossible."
And I really spend a lot of time wondering, how much truth do we tell?
What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?
How do we know when we are ourselves?
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories, you know, are real sentences?
Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?
I'm going to quickly go through this.
A quote by Bertrand Russell, "All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction.
So now, my friends, if that is true, and it is true, what is the point?"
A complicated question.
And so, you know, I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.
Oh my God, you know what?
Could we have -- no, we don't have time.
I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the -- you know, could we have it for a second?
Do you have that?
OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85.
So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because, you know, we're from Russia.
I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96, and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style," she said she would treasure it.
And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said, "When you met him, you knew it was him."
And she said, "I knew it was he."
So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.
And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.
Gershwin died at the age of 38.
He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.
I don't want to talk about that now.
I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.
I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.
And I would like to run it for them.
And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise, who's also still working, and I looked at her sink, which is really amazing, and left.
And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
And then I go and have some tea.
And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died, she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.
And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see that Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father, a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx, won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.
That's actually Hy.
And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit, and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.
And it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata, which I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore, give me a break," but I was wrong.
It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.
I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.

<title>Danny Hillis: The Internet could crash. We need a Plan B</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The Internet connects billions of people and machines; it's the backbone of modern life. But tech pioneer Danny Hillis thinks the Internet just wasn't designed to grow this big -- and he fears that one big cyber-attack or glitch could shut it down and take civilization with it. To head off a digital dark age, he sounds a clarion call to develop a Plan B: a parallel system to fall back on if -- or when -- the Internet crashes.</description>
So, this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982.
Actually, it's deceptively large.
There's actually only about 20 people on each page, because we have the name, address and telephone number of every single person.
And, in fact, everybody's listed twice, because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.
Obviously a very small community.
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.
I knew them both.
We didn't all know each other, but we all kind of trusted each other, and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network, and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things.
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community, let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days.
Now, it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet.
So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
So I picked think.com, but then I thought, you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case.
And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."
That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days, and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network, but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself.
So the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol, and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it, were fundamentally "from each according to their ability, to each according to their need."
And so, if you had some extra bandwidth, you'd deliver a message for someone.
If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.
You'd kind of depend on people to do that, and that was the building block.
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department, but it obviously worked really well, and we all saw what happened with the Internet.
It was incredibly successful.
In fact, it was so successful that there's no way that these days you could make a book like this.
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.
But, of course, you couldn't do it, because we don't know the names of all the people with Internet or email addresses, and even if we did know their names, I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name, address and telephone number published to everyone.
So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days, and so we dealt with that by making walled communities, secure subnetworks, VPNs, little things that aren't really the Internet but are made out of the same building blocks, but we're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.
And that means that it's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen, or certain kinds of deliberate attacks, but even the mistakes can be bad.
So, for instance, in all of Asia recently, it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.
They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did because of the way that the protocols work.
Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is, you may remember a couple of years ago, all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it.
Now, you don't really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet, and in some sense it doesn't.
I'll come back to that later.
But the fact is that people couldn't take off because something was going wrong on the Internet, and the router card was down.
And so, there are many of those things that start to happen.
Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.
All of a sudden, a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet, including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations, started getting re-routed through China.
So for a few hours, it all passed through China.
Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake, and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work, but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to, and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.
So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days, they're not going to do it with tanks.
That will not succeed.
What they'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility.
Nobody has claimed credit for that.
There was basically a factory of industrial machines.
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet, but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there, or something like that, and software got in there that causes the centrifuges, in that case, to actually destroy themselves.
Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.
And so there's a lot of -- I'm sure you've read a lot in papers, about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those.
But the fact is, people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet, and there's been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.
And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.
So actually, in the early days, back when it was the ARPANET, there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it.
And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places, and this one processor, because of a broken card, decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time.
So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.
So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy, who would send it back in time and get it there super early, so every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node, and of course that clogged everything up.
Everything started breaking.
The interesting thing was, though, that the sysadmins were able to fix it, but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.
Now, of course you couldn't do that today.
I mean, everything off, it's like the service call you get from the cable company, except for the whole world.
Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.
One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now, and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things, like when you take off from LAX, you're really not thinking you're using the Internet.
When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.
What's happening increasingly, though, is these systems are beginning to use the Internet.
Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet, but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions, for administrative functions, and so if you take something like the cell phone system, which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part, Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions, and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well, they're cheap, they're repeated, and so on.
So all of our systems, more and more, are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology.
And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other.
That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.
So we've built this system where we understand all the parts of it, but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it, and it's gotten a very, very different scale than it was designed for.
And in fact, nobody really exactly understands all the things it's being used for right now.
It's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that, you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.
They have an informed opinion, but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on.
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet, it's just somebody's guess.
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago.
It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.
And the problem with it is, I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system, where we take a system that's basically built on trust, was basically built for a smaller-scale system, and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate.
And so right now, I think it's literally true that we don't know what the consequences of an effective denial-of-service attack on the Internet would be, and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year, and worse next year, and so on.
But so what we need is a plan B.
There is no plan B right now.
There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet, made out of completely different sets of building blocks.
So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily have to have the performance of the Internet, but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the Internet, or the hospitals have to order fuel oil.
This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.
It's actually relatively simple to do, technically, because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground, existing wireless infrastructure.
It's basically a matter of deciding to do it.
But people won't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it, and that's the problem that we have right now.
So there's been plenty of people, plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years, but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well.
So I think that, if people understand how much we're starting to depend on the Internet, and how vulnerable it is, we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist, and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it, I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.
It's not that hard a problem.
It could definitely be done by people in this room.
And so I think that this is actually, of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference, this is probably one of the very easiest to fix.
So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it.
Thank you very much.

<title>Michael Sandel: Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it's fair to say that an American's experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have. In a talk and audience discussion, Sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: In our current democracy, is too much for sale?</description>
Here's a question we need to rethink together: What should be the role of money and markets in our societies?
Today, there are very few things that money can't buy.
If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara, California, you should know that if you don't like the standard accommodations, you can buy a prison cell upgrade.
It's true. For how much, do you think?
What would you guess?
Five hundred dollars?
It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!
Eighty-two dollars a night.
Eighty-two dollars a night.
If you go to an amusement park and don't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides, there is now a solution.
In many theme parks, you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line.
They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.
And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.
In Washington, D.C., long lines, queues sometimes form for important Congressional hearings.
Now some people don't like to wait in long queues, maybe overnight, even in the rain.
So now, for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don't like to wait, there are companies, line-standing companies, and you can go to them.
You can pay them a certain amount of money, they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes, and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins, can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room.
Paid line standing.
It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions, in bigger arenas.
Take the way we fight our wars.
Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were U.S. military troops?
Now this isn't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies, but this is what has happened.
Over the past three decades, we have lived through a quiet revolution.
We've drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies.
The difference is this: A market economy is a tool, a valuable and effective tool, for organizing productive activity, but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale.
It's a way of life, in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life: personal relations, family life, health, education, politics, law, civic life.
Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming market societies?
For two reasons, I think.
One of them has to do with inequality.
The more things money can buy, the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.
If the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs, then inequality wouldn't matter very much.
But when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life -- decent health care, access to the best education, political voice and influence in campaigns -- when money comes to govern all of those things, inequality matters a great deal.
And so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence.
That's one reason to worry.
There's a second reason apart from the worry about inequality, and it's this: with some social goods and practices, when market thinking and market values enter, they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about.
I'd like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism, a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.
Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids, especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard, to do well in school, to apply themselves.
Some economists have proposed a market solution: Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books.
They've tried this, actually.
They've done some experiments in some major American cities.
In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C., they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A, 35 dollars for a B.
In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.
So let's see what -- Some people are in favor, some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement.
Let's see what people here think about it.
Imagine that you are the head of a major school system, and someone comes to you with this proposal.
And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.
You don't have to take it out of your budget.
How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try?
Let's see by a show of hands.
First, how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work? Raise your hand.
And how many would be opposed? How many would -- So the majority here are opposed, but a sizable minority are in favor.
Let's have a discussion.
Let's start with those of you who object, who would rule it out even before trying.
What would be your reason?
Who will get our discussion started? Yes?
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike, and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation, so in the respect that children, if they would like to read, you just take this incentive away in just paying them, so it just changes behavior.
Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.
What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?
HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation should be to learn.
MS: To learn. HM: To get to know the world.
And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?
Then they stop reading?
MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors, who thinks it's worth trying this.
Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus, and you said worth a try, so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things?
MS: And measure. And what would you measure?
You'd measure how many -- EL: How many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them.
MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.
All right, what about that?
HM: To be frank, I just think this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.
MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion is the following question: Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation, the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey, which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes?
And people disagree about what the effect will be, but that seems to be the question, that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson, and if it does, what will become of these children later?
I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.
The cash for good grades has had very mixed results, for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.
The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books.
It also led them to read shorter books.
But the real question is, what will become of these kids later?
Will they have learned that reading is a chore, a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry, or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?
Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out is something that many economists overlook.
Economists often assume that markets are inert, that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.
Market exchange, they assume, doesn't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged.
This may be true enough if we're talking about material goods.
If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift, it will be the same good.
It will work the same either way.
But the same may not be true if we're talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life.
In those domains, bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about.
Once we see that markets and commerce, when extended beyond the material domain, can change the character of the goods themselves, can change the meaning of the social practices, as in the example of teaching and learning, we have to ask where markets belong and where they don't, where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about.
But to have this debate, we have to do something we're not very good at, and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize, from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning to civic life.
Now these are controversial questions, and so we tend to shrink from them.
In fact, during the past three decades, when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige, our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out, empty of larger moral meaning.
For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.
But once we see that markets change the character of goods, we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods.
One of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality, the sense that we are all in it together.
Against the background of rising inequality, marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives.
We live and work and shop and play in different places.
Our children go to different schools.
This isn't good for democracy, nor is it a satisfying way to live, even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line.
Here's why.
Democracy does not require perfect equality, but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life.
What matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another, bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life, because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences.
And this is how we come to care for the common good.
And so, in the end, the question of markets is not mainly an economic question.
It's really a question of how we want to live together.
Do we want a society where everything is up for sale, or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?
Thank you very much.

<title>Jeff Hancock: The future of lying</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Who hasn’t sent a text message saying “I’m on my way” when it wasn’t true or fudged the truth a touch in their online dating profile? But Jeff Hancock doesn’t believe that the anonymity of the internet encourages dishonesty. In fact, he says the searchability and permanence of information online may even keep us honest.</description>
Let me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.
And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race.
We have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism, a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves; a New York Times exposé on fake book reviews.
It's been fantastic.
Now, of course, not all deception hits the news.
Much of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.
So it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.
Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you, in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib, or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?
All right, good. These are all the liars.
Make sure you pay attention to them.
No, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.
The other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot, or you're lying to me about your lying, which is very, very devious. This fits with a lot of the research, which suggests that lying is very pervasive.
It's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human, the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up, that has fascinated people throughout history.
Here we have Diogenes with his lantern.
Does anybody know what he was looking for?
A single honest man, and he died without finding one back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East who was really concerned with sincerity, not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk, but that you believed in what you were doing.
You believed in your principles.
Now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.
I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.
Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders.
You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact, that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders.
Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs, one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong, and I'll tell you about some of that tonight.
But even since just 1995, '96, the way we communicate has been completely transformed. We email, we text, we skype, we Facebook. It's insane.
Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed, and of course that's had an impact on deception.
Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting.
They're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet and the Chinese Water Army.
It sounds a little bit like a weird book, but actually they're all new types of lies.
Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one: "On my way." Anybody ever written, "On my way?"
Then you've also lied.
We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way.
Here's another one: "Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier.
My battery was dead." Your battery wasn't dead.
You weren't in a dead zone.
You just didn't want to respond to that person that time.
Here's the last one: You're talking to somebody, and you say, "Sorry, got work, gotta go."
But really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.
Each of these is about a relationship, and this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number, you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.
And so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer, like the butler used to do, between us and the connections to everybody else.
But they're very special. They use ambiguity that comes from using technology. You don't know where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.
And they're aimed at protecting the relationships.
These aren't just people being jerks. These are people that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now, or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.
Our relationship is still important.
Now, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand, is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't about ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.
Let me give you a very recent example, as in, like, last week.
Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.
Here's one of his bestselling books.
Here's a reviewer online, on Amazon.
My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is, "Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."
And of course, you might suspect that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.
He wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.
Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.
Walt Whitman also did this back in the day, before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale, which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.
Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people in China that are paid small amounts of money to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be propaganda. The government hires these people, companies hire them, all over the place.
In North America, we call this Astroturfing, and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.
We see this especially with product reviews, book reviews, everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.
Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception, you might think, wow, the Internet is really making us a deceptive species, especially when you think about the Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.
But actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.
Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms, which I'm sure none of you have been in.
I can assure you there's deception there.
And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the 43 million out of the country.
Let's forget about that guy, too.
Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.
Those are the conversations that really matter.
What does technology do to deception with those folks?
Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days, and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium, and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media.
And it really throws people for a loop because we think, well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?
The phone, in contrast, the most lies.
Again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.
This tends to be very different from what people expect.
What about résumés? We did a study in which we had people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn, which is a social networking site like Facebook, but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé.
And what we found, to many people's surprise, was that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest on the things that mattered to employers, like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job.
How about Facebook itself?
You know, we always think that hey, there are these idealized versions, people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times.
My friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.
They had four good friends of a person judge their personality.
Then they had strangers, many strangers, judge the person's personality just from Facebook, and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical, highly correlated, meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.
All right, well, what about online dating?
I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.
I'm sure you all have "friends" that have used online dating.
And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.
Well, we were really interested in it, and so what we did is we brought people, online daters, into the lab, and then we measured them. We got their height up against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight -- ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.
And what we found was very, very interesting.
Here's an example of the men and the height.
Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.
Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.
That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it, they were telling exactly the truth.
Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.
What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.
In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch, what we say in the lab as "strong rounding up."
You get to 5'8" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9".
But what's really important here is, look at all those dots.
They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.
One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date, a coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said, game over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied subtly, not too much. They were constrained.
Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact that despite our intuitions, mine included, a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated communication, is more honest than face to face?
That really is strange. How do we explain this?
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials, hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception, really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.
That's really bad. Why is it so bad?
Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.
If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?
Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.
And you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture, one of the top cues is eyes. But the research over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue to deception, which blew me away, and it's one of the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.
The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.
Some situations, yes -- high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate, their pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit, but not all the time, not for everybody, it's not reliable.
Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense, but one important finding is that we lie for a reason.
We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else's gain.
So there are some pathological liars, but they make up a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.
Just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie.
But I think there's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language.
Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.
A lot of humans have lived since then.
We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about, but they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said, there's a lot of humans evolving speaking, about 100 billion people in fact.
What's important though is that writing only emerged about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing, every word that they ever said, every utterance disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone.
So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record. In fact, even the next big change to writing was only 500 years ago now, with the printing press, which is very recent in our past, and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II, so even the people of the last two millennia, most of the words they ever said -- poof! -- disappeared.
Let's turn to now, the networked age.
How many of you have recorded something today?
Anybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?
It looks like almost every single person here recorded something.
In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre-ancient history.
That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear, but we're in an environment where we're recording everything.
In fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just what we write that will be recorded, everything we do will be recorded.
What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?
Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.
I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.
You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review, they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.
So one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of looking at the language, is we paid people to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.
The person never was at the James Hotel.
The other review is real. The person stayed there.
Now, your task now is to decide which review is fake?
I'll give you a moment to read through them.
But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.
Remember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.
All right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?
All right. Very good. About half.
And how many of you think that B is?
All right. Slightly more for B.
Excellent. Here's the answer.
B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group.
You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this, it's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits with the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.
Those cold, hard winters, I love it.
All right, so why do I care about this?
Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception.
Let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think about narrative. They make up a story: Who? And what happened? And that's what happened here.
Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular, I, way more than the people that actually stayed there.
They were inserting themselves into the hotel review, kind of trying to convince you they were there.
In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there, their bodies actually entered the physical space, they talked a lot more about spatial information.
They said how big the bathroom was, or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.
Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.
This isn't a deception-detection machine to tell if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.
We believe that every lie now, every type of lie -- fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews, your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging -- those are all different lies. They're going to have different patterns of language. But because everything's recorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.
Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.
It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression, about everything from love to attitudes, because everything is being recorded now, but what does it mean for the average citizen?
What does it mean for us in our lives?
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas, I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.
My outbox for email is massive, and I never look at it. I write all the time, but I never look at my record, at my trace.
And I think we're going to see a lot more of that, where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote, what we said, what we did.
Now, if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple of take-away things here.
First, lying online can be very dangerous, right?
Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine, but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to, and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms.
So by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.
But when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives, I think we can go back to Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie, and more concerned about being true to the self, and I think this is really important.
Now, when you are about to say or do something, we can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy, part of my personal record?
Because in the digital age we live in now, in the networked age, we are all leaving a record.
Thank you so much for your time, and good luck with your record.

<title>Stefan Larsson: What doctors can learn from each other</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Different hospitals produce different results on different procedures. Only, patients don’t know that data, making choosing a surgeon a high-stakes guessing game. Stefan Larsson looks at what happens when doctors measure and share their outcomes on hip replacement surgery, for example, to see which techniques are proving the most effective. Could health care get better -- and cheaper -- if doctors learn from each other in a continuous feedback loop?</description>
Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical, and I returned to the medical university where I studied.
I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years, in fact since I became a management consultant.
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent.
The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting, and the second thing, which really bothered me, actually, was that several of the colleagues I met, former friends from medical school, who I knew to be some of the smartest, most motivated, engaged and passionate people I'd ever met, many of them had turned cynical, disengaged, or had distanced themselves from hospital management.
So with this focus on cost-cutting, I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare.
It's a big part of the national budgets.
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth.
In some countries, we have long waiting times for patients for surgery.
In other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed, and therefore don't reach patients.
In several countries, doctors and nurses are the targets, to some extent, for the governments.
After all, the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses.
You choose an expensive lab test, you choose to operate on an old and frail patient.
So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians, this is a way to hold costs down.
And ultimately, some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients.
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated.
At BCG, we looked at this, and we asked ourselves, this can't be the right way of managing healthcare.
And so we took a step back and we said, "What is it that we are trying to achieve?"
Ultimately, in the healthcare system, we're aiming at improving health for the patients, and we need to do so at a limited, or affordable, cost.
We call this value-based healthcare.
On the screen behind me, you see what we mean by value: outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend.
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.
On this picture, you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters.
When we started doing our research at BCG, we decided not to look so much at the costs, but to look at the quality instead, and in the research, one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw.
You compare hospitals in a country, you'll find some that are extremely good, but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse.
The differences were dramatic.
Erik, my father-in-law, he suffers from prostate cancer, and he probably needs surgery.
Now living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system.
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital, he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent, so he would have to start wearing diapers again.
You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.
If he instead would go to Hamburg, and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik, the risk would be only one in 20.
Either you a flip a coin, or you have a one in 20 risk.
That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.
When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases, we see these huge differences.
But you and I don't know. We don't have the data.
And often, the data actually doesn't exist.
Nobody knows.
So going the hospital is a lottery.
Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.
In the late '70s, there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting, and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery.
To the left of this slide, you see a variety of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip.
They all realized they had their individual way of operating.
They all argued that, "My technique is the best," but none of them actually knew, and they admitted that.
So they said, "We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best."
So they in fact spent two years debating, "So what is quality in hip surgery?"
"Oh, we should measure this." "No, we should measure that."
And they finally agreed.
And once they had agreed, they started measuring, and started sharing the data.
Very quickly, they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in, it actually lasted a lot longer, and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime.
They published the data, and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country.
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.
Since then, they publish every year.
Once a year, they publish the league table: who's best, who's at the bottom?
And they visit each other to try to learn, so a continuous cycle of improvement.
For many years, Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world, at least for those who actually were measuring, and many were not.
Now I found this principle really exciting.
So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it.
Continuous improvement.
Now, that's not the only exciting part.
That's exciting in itself.
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation, and look at that, it turns out, those who have focused on quality, they actually also have the lowest costs, although that's not been the purpose in the first place.
So if you look at the hip surgery story again, there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden.
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.
In the United States, the number was three times higher than in Sweden.
So many unnecessary surgeries, and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period.
Now, you can imagine how much savings there would be for society.
We did a study where we looked at OECD data.
OECD does, every so often, look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries.
The United States has, for many diseases, actually a quality which is below the average in OECD.
Now, if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality, and raise quality just to the level of average OECD, it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year.
That's 20 percent of the budget, of the healthcare budget of the country.
Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic, and it's all logical, but is it possible?
This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare, and I would argue that not only can it be done, but it has to be done.
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system.
In my practice as a consultant, I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year.
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients.
Physicians are, like most of you in the audience, very competitive.
They were always best in class.
We were always best in class.
And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do, they will do whatever it takes to improve.
But most of them don't know.
But physicians have another characteristic.
They actually thrive from peer recognition.
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results, they will share.
They will share the information on how to improve.
So it is, by measuring and creating transparency, you get a cycle of continuous improvement, which is what this slide shows.
Now, you may say this is a nice idea, but this isn't only an idea.
This is happening in reality.
We're creating a global community, and a large global community, where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve.
Together with two academic institutions, Michael Porter at Harvard Business School, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, BCG has formed something we call ICHOM.
You may think that's a sneeze, but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement.
We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss, disease by disease, what is really quality, what should we measure, and to make those standards global.
They've worked -- four working groups have worked during the past year: cataracts, back pain, coronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack, and prostate cancer.
The four groups will publish their data in November of this year.
That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples, not only within a country, but between countries.
Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases, the year after, 16.
In three years' time, we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden.
Compare apples to apples. Who's better?
Why is that?
Five months ago, I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe.
They have a new CEO, and she has a vision: I want to manage my big institution much more on quality, outcomes that matter to patients.
This particular day, we sat in a workshop together with physicians, nurses and other staff, discussing leukemia in children.
The group discussed, how do we measure quality today?
Can we measure it better than we do?
We discussed, how do we treat these kids, what are important improvements?
And we discussed what are the costs for these patients, can we do treatment more efficiently?
There was an enormous energy in the room.
There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman of the department, he stood up.
He looked over the group and he said -- first he raised his hand, I forgot that -- he raised his hand, clenched his fist, and then he said to the group, "Thank you.
Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way."
By measuring value in healthcare, that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients, we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution.
I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution, and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates, who always put the patient at the center, he would smile in his grave.
Thank you.

<title>Brian Cox: Why we need the explorers</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In tough economic times, our exploratory science programs -- from space probes to the LHC -- are first to suffer budget cuts. Brian Cox explains how curiosity-driven science pays for itself, powering innovation and a profound appreciation of our existence.</description>
We live in difficult and challenging economic times, of course.
And one of the first victims of difficult economic times, I think, is public spending of any kind, but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science, and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration.
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do.
But I think to set the scene, I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED, but it is a bit of a mess.
But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs.
Because, if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration, I should tell you how much it costs.
So this is a game called "spot the science budgets."
This is the U.K. government spend.
You see there, it's about 620 billion a year.
The science budget is actually -- if you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs.
And it's one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob.
It's about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion.
That funds everything in the U.K.
from medical research, space exploration, where I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics, engineering, even arts and humanities, funded from the science budget, which is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen.
So that's what we're arguing about.
That percentage, by the way, is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France.
R&amp;D in total in the economy, publicly funded, is about 0.6 percent of GDP.
So that's what we're arguing about.
The first thing I want to say, and this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System," is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.
This is a picture that actually was sent back by the Cassini space probe around Saturn, after we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System."
So it isn't in the series.
It's of the moon Enceladus.
So that big sweeping, white sphere in the corner is Saturn, which is actually in the background of the picture.
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus, which is about as big as the British Isles.
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.
So, tiny moon.
What's fascinating and beautiful ...
this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say, it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.
What's beautiful is, you can probably see on the limb there some faint, sort of, wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb.
This is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System."
It's a beautiful graphic.
What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon.
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself, but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon.
And what's important about that is that, on our planet, on Earth, wherever we find liquid water, we find life.
So, to find strong evidence of liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon 750 million miles away from the Earth is really quite astounding.
So what we're saying, essentially, is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.
Well, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.
That's one more picture of Enceladus.
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.
So it made a very low pass, just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.
And so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space, absolutely beautiful.
But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system.
That's probably this place, which is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.
And again, we had to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that this moon, as most moons, was anything other than a dead ball of rock.
It's actually an ice moon.
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa, which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.
But by measuring the way that Europa interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter, and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around, we've inferred very strongly that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa.
So below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.
We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.
So that place, a little moon around Jupiter, is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth, that we know of.
Tremendous and beautiful discovery.
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.
It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask, which is: "Are we alone in the universe?"
Is there any other use to exploration and science, other than just a sense of wonder?
Well, there is.
This is a very famous picture taken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve, December 24th, 1968, when I was about eight months old.
It was taken by Apollo 8 as it went around the back of the moon.
Earthrise from Apollo 8.
A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture that saved 1968, which was a turbulent year -- the student riots in Paris, the height of the Vietnam War.
The reason many people think that about this picture, and Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED, is that this picture, arguably, was the beginning of the environmental movement.
Because, for the first time, we saw our world, not as a solid, immovable, but as a very small, fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space.
What's also not often said about the space exploration, about the Apollo program, is the economic contribution it made.
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this, it cost a lot, didn't it?
Well, actually, many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness, the economic impact of Apollo.
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.
And it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo, 14 came back into the U.S. economy.
So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration, in engineering, achievement and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over.
So exploration can pay for itself.
What about scientific discovery?
What about driving innovation?
Well, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.
What it is, is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen.
See, back in the 1880s, 1890s, many scientists, many observers, looked at the light given off from atoms.
And they saw strange pictures like this.
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light, it just emits light at particular colors, a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them.
And the electrons can only be in particular places.
And when they jump up to the next place they can be, and fall back down again, they emit light at particular colors.
And so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up, only emit light at very specific colors, was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory, the theory of the structure of atoms.
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.
And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing light.
And again, they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down, jump up and fall down.
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.
And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element.
And that's why helium's called helium.
It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun.
Now, that sounds esoteric, and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit, but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon, for example.
The way that silicon behaves, the fact that you can build transistors, is a purely quantum phenomenon.
So without that curiosity-driven understanding of the structure of atoms, which led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics, then we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips, we wouldn't have pretty much the basis of our modern economy.
There's one more, I think, wonderful twist to that tale.
In "Wonders of the Solar System," we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.
It's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth, is you can transport it, not only to the planets, but to the most distant stars and galaxies.
And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics, just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory, get a telescope, swing it to the sky, and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
That's quite an incredible prediction.
What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass?
Well, this is a picture of it.
This is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy with, what, 100 billion stars like our Sun in it.
It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.
There are a billion stars in the galactic core, which is why it's shining out so brightly.
This is about 50 million light years away, so one of our neighboring galaxies.
But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.
So that star is also 50 million light years away.
It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it.
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion.
Now that's an incredible phenomena, because it's a star that sits there.
It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.
And it has a binary companion that goes around it, so a big star, a big ball of gas.
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star, until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit, and then it explodes.
And it explodes, and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks, and releases, not only energy, but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.
In fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
Now, there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang.
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars.
It was made in stars like that, locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets, stars, new solar systems and, indeed, people like us.
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics, because we understand that process, because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth.
This is a beautiful quote that I found -- we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming: "When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic."
Now, the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor.
And they certainly didn't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions, which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe.
So, I think science can be -- serendipity is important.
It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.
It can also, I think, finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet.
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.
It was taken by the Cassini space probe.
But it's a famous picture, not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings, but actually because of a tiny, faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings.
And if I blow it up there, you see it.
It looks like a moon, but in fact, it's a picture of Earth.
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.
That's our planet from 750 million miles away.
I think the Earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it, the more beautiful it seems.
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.
It was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.
And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.
The Voyager is a tiny machine.
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth, transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts, and we're still in contact with it.
But it visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
And after it visited all four of those planets, Carl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes, had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited.
And it took this picture of Earth.
Now it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture, but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.
That's Earth from four billion miles away.
And I'd like to read you what Sagan wrote about it, just to finish, because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken.
He said, "Consider again that dot.
That's here. That's home. That's us.
On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of, every human being who ever was lived out their lives.
The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there, on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.
It's been said that astronomy's a humbling and character-building experience.
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.
To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."
Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration.
The argument has always been made, and it will always be made, that we know enough about the universe.
You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.
You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.
And it's made today in these difficult economic times.
Surely, we know enough.
We don't need to discover anything else about our universe.
Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine, Humphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.
He was clearly under assault all the time.
"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.
Just exploit it; just build things."
He said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate, that our triumphs are complete, that there are no mysteries in nature, and that there are no new worlds to conquer."
Thank you.

<title>Jonathan Trent: Energy from floating algae pods</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Call it "fuel without fossils": Jonathan Trent is working on a plan to grow new biofuel by farming micro-algae in floating offshore pods that eat wastewater from cities. Hear his team's bold vision for Project OMEGA and how it might power the future.</description>
Some years ago, I set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture for water, fertilizer or land.
So here's what I came up with.
Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil, and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater, and the system that we're going to build, of course, will use solar energy to grow the algae, and they use CO2, which is good, and they produce oxygen as they grow.
The algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water, and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed, and of course you'd have to make a large area of this, so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things, but hey, we're talking about biofuels, and we know the importance of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel.
Why are we talking about microalgae?
Here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels, so you can see some things like soybean, which makes 50 gallons per acre per year, or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.
That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000 and 5,000 gallons per acre per year, compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.
So what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro -- that is, they're extremely small, as you can see here a picture of those single-celled organisms compared to a human hair.
Those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world, some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet, and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.
Now, why do we want to do this offshore?
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice, because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested, and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.
This is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles of sewer pipes under the city already, and it releases its waste water offshore.
So different cities around the world treat their waste water differently. Some cities process it.
Some cities just release the water.
But in all cases, the water that's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae.
So let's envision what the system might look like.
We call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.
At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.
So how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.
We put waste water and some source of CO2 into our floating structure, and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow, and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.
They of course use solar energy to grow, and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae, and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature.
The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned, and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and other bi-algal products of interest.
And the system is contained. What do I mean by that?
It's modular. Let's say something happens that's totally unexpected to one of the modules.
It leaks. It's struck by lightning.
The waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment, and the algae that leak out are biodegradable, and because they're living in waste water, they're fresh water algae, which means they can't live in salt water, so they die.
The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of well-known plastic that we have good experience with, and we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.
So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about this system that I'm showing you, and that is to say we need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water, which is also going to be an issue in the future, and we're working on methods now for recovering the waste water.
The other thing to consider is the structure itself.
It provides a surface for things in the ocean, and this surface, which is covered by seaweeds and other organisms in the ocean, will become enhanced marine habitat so it increases biodiversity.
And finally, because it's an offshore structure, we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture activity offshore.
So you're probably thinking, "Gee, this sounds like a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"
Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz at the California Fish and Game facility, and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas.
We also set up experiments in San Francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants, again a facility to test ideas.
And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be in the marine environment, and we set up a field site at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab in Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms.
The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.
It was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes, or, as Edison said, we were finding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.
Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow, what makes them happy, how do we make sure that we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.
So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these so-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.
These were the structures that would be floating at the surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material that'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots of designs, most of which were horrible failures, and when we finally got to a design that worked, at about 30 gallons, we scaled it up to 450 gallons in San Francisco.
So let me show you how the system works.
We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it, and we circulate it through this floating structure, this tubular, flexible plastic structure, and it circulates through this thing, and there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface, and the algae grow on the nutrients.
But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.
The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2, as we would.
They suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they don't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce is problematic, and they use up all the CO2.
So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could remove the oxygen, which we did by building this column which circulated some of the water, and put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system before we recirculated the water.
And what you see here is the prototype, which was the first attempt at building this type of column.
The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco in the installed system.
So the column actually had another very nice feature, and that is the algae settle in the column, and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass in a context where we could easily harvest it.
So we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column, and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net.
So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment, and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in Moss Landing Marine Lab.
Well, we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting, and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things, but that's for the future.
Now really what we were doing, we were working in four areas.
Our research covered the biology of the system, which included studying the way algae grew, but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.
We did engineering to understand what we would need to be able to do to build this structure, not only on the small scale, but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system, and finally we looked at the economics, and what I mean by economics is, what is the energy required to run the system?
Do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system to be able to make the system run?
And what about operating costs?
And what about capital costs?
And what about, just, the whole economic structure?
So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy, and there's lots more work to do in all four of those areas to be able to really make the system work.
But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you the artist's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay somewhere in the world, and we have in the background in this image, the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the CO2, but when you do the economics of this system, you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.
Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water, sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy, and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities, you could also include in such a facility aquaculture.
So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we're growing mussels or scallops.
We'd be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food, and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately, competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.
So there's always a big question that comes up, because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.
What are we going to do with all this plastic that we're going to need to use in our marine environment?
Well, I don't know if you know about this, but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch, and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil, and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season, it allows us to control weeds, and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.
So the OMEGA system will be part of this type of an outcome, and that when we're finished using it in the marine environment, we'll be using it, hopefully, on fields.
Where are we going to put this, and what will it look like offshore?
Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.
San Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day of waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention time for this system, we'd need 325 million gallons to accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.
Well, that's less than one percent of the surface area of the bay.
It would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year, it would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel, which is about 20 percent of the biodiesel, or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco, and that's without doing anything about efficiency.
Where else could we potentially put this system?
There's lots of possibilities.
There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.
San Diego Bay is another example, Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is, as sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider.
So what I'm telling you about is a system of integrated activities.
Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture.
I set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels, and en route I discovered that what's really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation.
Long term, I have great faith in our collective and connected ingenuity.
I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we don't care who gets the credit.
Sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many.
I think we need to consider everything, everything from alpha to OMEGA.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.
Can this project continue to move forward within NASA or do you need some very ambitious green energy fund to come and take it by the throat?
Jonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something which would go offshore, and there are a lot of issues with doing it in the United States because of limited permitting issues and the time required to get permits to do things offshore.
It really requires, at this point, people on the outside, and we're being radically open with this technology in which we're going to launch it out there for anybody and everybody who's interested to take it on and try to make it real.
CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.
You're publishing it.
JT: Absolutely.
CA: All right. Thank you so much.
JT: Thank you.

<title>Billy Collins: Everyday moments, caught in time</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Combining dry wit with artistic depth, Billy Collins shares a project in which several of his poems were turned into delightful animated films in a collaboration with Sundance Channel. Five of them are included in this wonderfully entertaining and moving talk -- and don't miss the hilarious final poem!</description>
I'm here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry.
And the way I'm going to do that is present to you five animations of five of my poems.
And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.
Because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.
But when I was United States Poet Laureate -- and I love saying that.
It's a great way to start sentences.
When I was him back then, I was approached by J. Walter Thompson, the ad company, and they were hired sort of by the Sundance Channel.
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them.
And I was initially resistant, because I always think poetry can stand alone by itself.
Attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results, in all cases.
And the poem, if it's written with the ear, already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed.
And surely, if you're reading a poem that mentions a cow, you don't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow.
I mean, let's let the reader do a little work.
But I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility, and also I'm like a total cartoon junkie since childhood.
I think more influential than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth on my imagination were Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies and Loony Tunes cartoons.
Bugs Bunny is my muse.
And this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places.
And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places -- poetry on buses, poetry on subways, on billboards, on cereal boxes.
When I was Poet Laureate, there I go again -- I can't help it, it's true -- I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines that lasted for a couple of years.
So you could tune into poetry as you were flying.
And my sense is, it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life.
Start a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you.
When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever, it happens to you so suddenly that you don't have time to deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields that were installed in high school.
So let us start with the first one.
It's a little poem called "Budapest," and in it I reveal, or pretend to reveal, the secrets of the creative process.
Narration: "Budapest."
My pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater.
I watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly, intent as any forager that has nothing on its mind but the grubs and insects that will allow it to live another day.
It wants only to be here tomorrow, dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt, nose pressed against the page, writing a few more dutiful lines while I gaze out the window and imagine Budapest or some other city where I have never been.
BC: So that makes it seem a little easier.
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.
But I like to pretend that it comes with ease.
One of my students came up after class, an introductory class, and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing," which I found both erroneous and profound.
So I like to at least pretend it just flows out.
A friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.
He says that, "If at first you don't succeed, hide all evidence you ever tried."
The next poem is also rather short.
Poetry just says a few things in different ways.
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying, "Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."
And it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture.
Narration: "Some Days."
Some days I put the people in their places at the table, bend their legs at the knees, if they come with that feature, and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.
All afternoon they face one another, the man in the brown suit, the woman in the blue dress -- perfectly motionless, perfectly behaved.
But other days I am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table.
Very funny.
But how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next if you were going to spend it striding around like a vivid god, your shoulders in the clouds, or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic face?
BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.
The next poem is called forgetfulness, and it's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage.
And the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia, in other words, forgetting the things that you have read.
Narration: "Forgetfulness."
The name of the author is the first to go, followed obediently by the title, the plot, the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel, which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of.
It is as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones.
Long ago, you kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag.
And even now, as you memorize the order of the planets, something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps, the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay.
Whatever it is you are struggling to remember, it is not poised on the tip of your tongue, not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.
It has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall, well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.
No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.
No wonder the Moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.
BC: The next poem is called "The Country" and it's based on, when I was in college I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.
He lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.
I lived in New York City.
And we would visit each other.
And when I would go up to the country, he would teach me things like deer hunting, which meant getting lost with a gun basically -- and trout fishing and stuff like that.
And then he'd come down to New York City and I'd teach him what I knew, which was largely smoking and drinking.
And in that way we traded lore with each other.
The poem that's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that I had a very hard time, at first, processing.
It's called "The Country."
Narration: "The Country."
I wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house, because the mice might get into them and start a fire.
But your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches, you said, are always stowed.
Who could sleep that night?
Who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper, gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth?
Who could not see him rounding a corner, the blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam, the sudden flare and the creature, for one bright, shining moment, suddenly thrust ahead of his time -- now a fire-starter, now a torch-bearer in a forgotten ritual, little brown druid illuminating some ancient night?
And who could fail to notice, lit up in the blazing insulation, the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice -- one-time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country?
BC: Thank you.
Thank you. And the last poem is called "The Dead."
I wrote this after a friend's funeral, but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying, as all eulogists tend to do, which is how happy the deceased would be to look down and see all of us assembled.
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife, having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.
So the little poem is called "The Dead."
Narration: "The Dead."
The dead are always looking down on us, they say.
While we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich, they are looking down through the glass-bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity.
They watch the tops of our heads moving below on Earth.
And when we lie down in a field or on a couch, drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon, they think we are looking back at them, which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes.
BC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.
It took a long time -- I mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage -- a long time to put those two together.
But then again, it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together.
I mean, we had the wheel for some time.
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.
I just have time to read a more recent poem to you.
If it has a subject, the subject is adolescence.
And it's addressed to a certain person.
It's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl."
"Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon on the day you were born, you would be all done in only one more year?
Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone.
So never mind; you're fine just being yourself.
You're loved for just being you.
But did you know that at your age Judy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture, Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room -- no wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?
Of course, there will be time for all that later in your life, after you come out of your room and begin to blossom, or at least pick up all your socks.
For some reason I keep remembering that Lady Jane Grey was queen of England when she was only 15.
But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.
A few centuries later, when he was your age, Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family, but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies, four operas and two complete masses as a youngster.
But of course, that was in Austria at the height of Romantic lyricism, not here in the suburbs of Cleveland.
Frankly, who cares if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15 or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?
We think you're special just being you -- playing with your food and staring into space.
By the way, I lied about Schubert doing the dishes, but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house."
Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks.

<title>Janna Levin: The sound the universe makes</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We think of space as a silent place. But physicist Janna Levin says the universe has a soundtrack -- a sonic composition that records some of the most dramatic events in outer space. An accessible and mind-expanding soundwalk through the universe.</description>
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected off the Moon.
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.
And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky.
We can't see them directly.
They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.
We can see them indirectly, because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.
They destroy stars around them.
They churn up debris in their surroundings.
But they won't come to us directly through light.
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Now even light will be bent by those paths.
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.
These are the natural curves in space.
What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.
It wasn't Einstein who realized this, it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I -- joined the German army already an accomplished scientist, working on the Russian front.
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire, and then, in between, calculating Einstein's equations -- as you do in the trenches.
And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity, and he was thrilled by this theory.
And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary: curves so strong that space would rain down into them, space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole.
And even light could not escape this current.
Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be, and all that would be left would be a shadow.
Now he wrote to Einstein, and he said, "As you will see, the war has been kind to me enough.
Despite the heavy gunfire, I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas."
And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution, and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.
And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.
And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.
This was one of the groups.
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.
If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.
You would literally hear the sound.
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
Then it's gone.
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.
Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
And then they're going to merge.
Now it's gone.
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.
When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"
But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang.
It might make a sound.
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.
And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
That song has been ringing through space for all that time.
We weren't even here.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
It's like hurry, build your instruments.
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.
It's a terrible sound.
It's literally the definition of noise.
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.
So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
Will it happen again?
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?
Here's my multiverse creatures.
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?
And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you.

<title>Usman Riaz + Preston Reed: A young guitarist meets his hero</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Usman Riaz is a 21-year-old whiz at the percussive guitar, a style he learned to play by watching his heroes on YouTube. The TED Fellow plays onstage at TEDGlobal 2012 -- followed by a jawdropping solo from the master of percussive guitar, Preston Reed. And watch these two guitarists take on a very spur-of-the-moment improv.</description>
Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.
That's amazing.
You just don't hear that every day.
Usman, the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I -- That was the first thing I learned, and then I started progressing to other things.
And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be -- CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?
UR: I'd never learned it before, but he told me that we would be playing that on stage, so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.
And it finally happened, so ...
CA: Preston, from your point of view, I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?
How does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it?
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing, and I feel really proud, really honored.
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.
CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?
PR: We haven't prepared anything.
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and we just see that, I just think -- I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.

<title>Joe Kowan: How I beat stage fright</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Humanity's fine-tuned sense of fear served us well as a young species, giving us laser focus to avoid being eaten by competing beasts. But it's less wonderful when that same visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at a Tuesday night open-mic. Palms sweat, hands shake, vision blurs, and the brain says RUN: it's stage fright. In this charming, tuneful little talk, Joe Kowan talks about how he conquered it.</description>
Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.
I've always had stage fright, and not just a little bit, it's a big bit.
And it didn't even matter until I was 27.
That's when I started writing songs, and even then I only played them for myself.
Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable.
But after a couple of years, just writing songs wasn't enough.
I had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people, but physiologically, I couldn't do it.
I had this irrational fear.
But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced, the more I wanted to perform.
So on the week of my 30th birthday, I decided I was going to go to this local open mic, and put this fear behind me.
Well, when I got there, it was packed.
There were like 20 people there.
And they all looked angry.
But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play, and I felt pretty good.
Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn, when my whole body rebelled, and this wave of anxiety just washed over me.
Now, when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.
So you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster.
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down, like digestion.
So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore.
Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your Spidey sense tingles, basically your whole body is trigger-happy.
That condition is not conducive to performing folk music.
I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic?
I have never been more terrified -- until now.
So then it was my turn, and somehow, I get myself onto the stage, I start my song, I open my mouth to sing the first line, and this completely horrible vibrato -- you know, when your voice wavers -- comes streaming out.
And this is not the good kind of vibrato, like an opera singer has, this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.
I mean, it's a nightmare.
I'm embarrassed, the audience is clearly uncomfortable, they're focused on my discomfort.
It was so bad.
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter.
And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for.
And I wanted more. But I knew I had to get past this nervousness.
That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.
And I did. I went back every single week, and sure enough, week after week, it didn't get any better. The same thing happened every week.
I couldn't shake it.
And that's when I had an epiphany.
And I remember it really well, because I don't have a lot of epiphanies.
All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness.
That only seems authentic when I have stage fright, and the more nervous I was, the better the song would be. Easy.
So I started writing a song about having stage fright.
First, fessing up to the problem, the physical manifestations, how I would feel, how the listener might feel.
And then accounting for things like my shaky voice, and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal, because I was nervous.
By having a song that explained what was happening to me, while it was happening, that gave the audience permission to think about it.
They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous, they could experience that with me, and we were all one big happy, nervous, uncomfortable family.
By thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem, I was able to take something that was blocking my progress, and turn it into something that was essential for my success.
And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance.
And then I could move on, and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease.
And eventually, over time, I didn't have to play the stage fright song at all.
Except for when I was really nervous, like now.
Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you?
Can I have a sip of water?
Thank you.
♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫ ♫ this stage fright is real. ♫ ♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫ ♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫ ♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫ ♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫ ♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫ ♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫ ♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫ ♫ And maybe I'll try to imagine you all without clothes. ♫ ♫ But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows. ♫ ♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫ ♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫ ♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫ ♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫ ♫ And you tell me, don't worry so much, you'll be great. ♫ ♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫ ♫ and I know how I get. ♫ ♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫ ♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫ ♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't help me when I sing. ♫ ♫ But we shouldn't talk about these things right now, ♫ ♫ really, I'm up on stage, and you're in the crowd. Hi. ♫ ♫ And I'm not making fun of unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫ ♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫ ♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫ ♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫ ♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫ ♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫ ♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫ ♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫ ♫ my vocal cords movin', ♫ ♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫

<title>Wolfgang Kessling: How to air-condition outdoor spaces</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: During the hot summer months, watching an outdoor sports match or concert can be tantamount to baking uncomfortably in the sun -- but it doesn’t have to be. At the TEDxSummit in Doha, physicist Wolfgang Kessling reveals sustainable design innovations that cool us from above and below, and even collects solar energy for later use.</description>
Good evening.
We are in this wonderful open-air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight, but when Qatar will host the football World Cup 10 years from now, 2022, we already heard it will be in the hot, very hot and sunny summer months of June and July.
And when Qatar has been assigned to the World Cup all, many people around the world have been wondering, how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football, run around in this desert climate? How would it be possible that spectators sit, enjoy themselves in open-air stadia in this hot environment?
Together with the architects of Albert Speer &amp; Partner, our engineers from Transsolar have been supporting, have been developing open-air stadia based on 100 percent solar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.
Let me tell you about that, but let me start with comfort.
Let me start with the aspect of comfort, because many people are confusing ambient temperature with thermal comfort.
We are used to looking at charts like that, and you see this red line showing the air temperature in June and July, and yes, that's right, it's picking up to 45 degrees C.
It's actually very hot.
But air temperature is not the full set of climatic parameters which define comfort.
Let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football, World Cups, Olympic Games around the world, looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities, and let me start with Mexico.
Mexico temperature has been, air temperature has been something between 15, up to 30 degrees C, and people enjoyed themselves.
It was a very comfortable game in Mexico City. Have a look.
Orlando, same kind of stadium, open-air stadium. People have been sitting in the strong sun, in the very high humidity in the afternoon, and they did not enjoy. It was not comfortable.
The air temperature was not too high, but it was not comfortable during these games.
What about Seoul? Seoul, because of broadcast rights, all the games have been in the late afternoon. Sun has already been set, so the games have been perceived as comfortable.
What about Athens? Mediterranean climate, but in the sun it was not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.
And we know that from Spain, we know that "sol y sombra."
If you have a ticket, and you get a ticket for the shade, you pay more, because you're in a more comfortable environment.
What about Beijing?
It's again, sun in the day and high humidity, and it was not comfortable.
So if I overlay, and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes, what we see is, in all these places, air temperature has been ranging something from 25 to 35, and if you go on the line, 30, of 30 degrees C ambient temperatures. If you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort, all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort, ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable.
So why is that?
This is because there are more parameters influencing our thermal comfort, which is the sun, the direct sun, the diffuse sun, which is wind, strong wind, mild wind, which is air humidity, which is the radiant temperature of the surroundings where we are in.
And this is air temperature.
All these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body, and scientists have developed a parameter, which is the perceived temperature, where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand which is the driving parameter that I feel comfort or that I don't feel comfort.
Which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature? And these parameters, these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism.
Because of our metabolism, we as human beings, we produce heat.
I'm excited, I'm talking to you, I'm probably producing 150 watts at the moment. You are sitting, you are relaxed, you're looking at me. It's probably 100 watts each person is producing, and we need to get rid of that energy. I need, with my body, to get rid of the energy, and the harder it is for myself, for my body, to get rid of the energy, the less comfort I feel.
That's it. And if I don't get rid of the energy, I will die.
If we overlay what happens during the football World Cup, what will happen in June, July, we will see, yes, air temperature will be much higher, but because the games and the plays will be in the afternoon, it's probably the same comfort rating we've found in other places which has perceived as non-comfortable.
So we sat together with a team which prepared the Bid Book, or goal, that we said, let's aim for perceived temperature, for outdoor comfort in this range, which is perceived with a temperature of 32 degrees Celsius perceived temperature, which is extremely comfortable.
People would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment.
But what does it mean?
If we just look on what happens, we see, temperature's too high.
If we apply the best architectural design, climate engineering design, we won't get much better.
So we need to do something active.
We need, for instance, to bring in radiant cooling technology, and we need to combine this with so-called soft conditioning.
And how does it look like in a stadium?
So the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort. First of all, it's shading. It needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and warm wind.
But that's not all what we need to do. We need to use active systems.
Instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium, we can use radiant cooling technologies, like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor.
And just by using cold water going through the water pipes, you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium, so you can create that comfort, and then by adding dry air instead of down-chilled air, the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs, to their individual energy balance.
They can adjust and find their comfort they need to find.
There are 12 stadia probably to come, but there are 32 training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train.
We applied the same concept: shading of the training pitch, using a shelter against wind, then using the grass.
Natural-watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature, and using dehumidified air to create comfort.
But even the best passive design wouldn't help.
We need active system.
And how do we do that?
Our idea for the bid was 100 percent solar cooling, based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia, we cover the roofs of the stadia with PV systems.
We don't borrow any energy from history.
We are not using fossil energies.
We are not borrowing energy from our neighbors.
We're using energy we can harvest on our roofs, and also on the training pitches, which will be covered with large, flexible membranes, and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics, giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time.
And this energy now is harvested throughout the year, sent into the grid, is replacing fossils in the grid, and when I need it for the cooling, I take it back from the grid and I use the solar energy which I have brought to the grid back when I need it for the solar cooling.
And I can do that in the first year and I can balance that in the next 10, and the next 20 years, this energy, which is necessary to condition a World Cup in Qatar, the next 20 years, this energy goes into the grid of Qatar.
So this -- Thank you very much.
This is not only useful for stadia. We can use that also in open-air places and streets, and we've been working on the City of the Future in Masdar, which is in the United Emirates, Abu Dhabi.
And I had the pleasure to work on the central plaza.
And the same idea to use there, to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable. People enjoy going there instead of going into a shopping mall, which is chilled down and which is cooled. We wanted to create an outdoor space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon, even in these sunny and hot summer months, and they can enjoy and meet there with their families.
And the same concept: shade against the sun, shade against the wind, and use, use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint.
And these beautiful umbrellas.
So I'd like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort, to your thermal environment, tonight and tomorrow, and if you'd like to learn more about that, I invite you to go to our website.
We uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort.
And I also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters, it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions, to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment, and we can do that with the best passive design, but also using the energy source of the site in Qatar which is the sun.
Thank you very much.
Shukran.

<title>Alan Kay: A powerful idea about ideas</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With all the intensity and brilliance for which he is known, Alan Kay envisions better techniques for teaching kids by using computers to illustrate experience in ways -– mathematically and scientifically -- that only computers can.</description>
A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here, what's going on with no difficulty at all.
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing, and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point.
He would have a great time.
And of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling, a speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case, he had a secret weapon yesterday, literally, in his sword swallowing act.
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on, but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.
So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense, but that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled, so we're actually looking forward to it.
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled.
And this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves.
And our friend, Betty Edwards, the "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables to her drawing class and says, "The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can't move your hand, but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.
It's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there."
And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."
She does this with cardboard, but since I have an expensive computer here I'll just rotate this little guy around and ...
Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times, because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.
So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.
They measure very, very carefully.
And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge, you'll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size.
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying, "We see things not as they are, but as we are."
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then, if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are, then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here. It's a waking dream, and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.
And what that means: "simple and understandable" might not be actually simple or understandable, and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.
The way I think of it is, we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind.
Once you start down at this very humble level, then you can start finding ways to see things.
And what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular, is that human beings have invented "brainlets" -- little additional parts for our brain -- made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways.
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus -- telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus -- various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly, in the ability to change perspective on things.
I'll talk about that a little bit.
It's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history.
And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more. We like more.
If we do more in a kind of a stupid way, the simplicity gets complex and, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties; another name for them could be "architecture" as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.
And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish, and they're in violent motion.
Those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world.
But how simple?
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago, I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen in conveying complex ideas simply.
But then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple."
And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side, and I found that they matched up very well.
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data.
Whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell, as a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything, but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology, and that is: why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed?
And what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous; they just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.
But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second; they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds; they're completely crowded together, they're jammed, they're bashing up against each other.
And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff, what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous, and I think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science.
So, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle.
So a kid who's 14 in high school gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem, which is a truly subtle and interesting proof, but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.
So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math, is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this: so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that, notice that we can move those triangles down like this.
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo. That is all you have to do.
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.
Now let's go to young children.
This is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher, but was a natural mathematician.
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician; she just had a feeling for math.
And here are her six-year-olds, and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square, or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.
And what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project, and then something like science.
So they had created these artifacts.
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious, which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was to slow them down so they'll think.
So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up.
But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out.
"What have you noticed about what you did?"
And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one, and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one, the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one, and then the next one.
She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two, so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six, where she wasn't sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was, but then she was confident again.
So that's what Lauren did.
And then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor, and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation, derived by six-year-olds.
Well, that's pretty amazing.
That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.
And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do.
I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.
So I'd like to draw a little car here -- I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him.
And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object, I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.
Each time I click it, car turn.
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again, I just drag these guys out and set them going.
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here?
So what if I click this down to zero?
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.
Make it go in the other direction.
But of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car, so the kids want to do a steering wheel; so they draw a steering wheel.
And we'll call this a wheel.
See this wheel's heading here?
If I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here, and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.
And it's interesting.
You know how much trouble the children have with variables, but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion, they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it.
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.
So if you look at the little script here, the speed is always going to be 30.
We're going to move the car according to that over and over again.
And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things; they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time, and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?
What do I get there?"
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.
So how do the children do science?
Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time.
Student 1: Ooh, this is nice.
Teacher: Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing.
Who's got the apple?
Alan Kay: They've got little stopwatches.
Student 2: What did you get? What did you get?
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.
Student 3: 0.99 seconds.
Teacher: So put "sponge ball" ...
Student 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball because they're two totally different weights, and if you drop them at the same time, maybe they'll drop at the same speed.
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment, and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.
And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child, only 400 years ago.
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase.
Now, what if we want to look at this more closely?
We can take a movie of what's going on, but even if we single stepped this movie, it's tricky to see what's going on.
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up.
So when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration," remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways, and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.
So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later, like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time, and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase in the speed is constant.
And they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.
We've done that already."
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?
So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there, but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time, we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.
Galileo, by the way, did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.
I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story, but it's a great story.
And I thought I would do just one thing on the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.
So once you have gravity, here's this -- increase the speed by something, increase the ship's speed.
If I start the little game here that the kids have done, it'll crash the space ship.
But if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!
One more.
Yeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?
I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes: Marshall McLuhan said, "Children are the messages that we send to the future," but in fact, if you think of it, children are the future we send to the future.
Forget about messages; children are the future, and children in the first and second world and, most especially, in the third world need mentors.
And this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops, and maybe 50 million next year.
But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.
That means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out, but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing.
I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface, and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.
It sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq -- we're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars -- so this is actually cheap.
And Einstein said, "Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."
Thank you.

<title>Emma Teeling: The secret of the bat genome</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In Western society, bats are often characterized as creepy, even evil. Zoologist Emma Teeling encourages us to rethink our attitude toward bats, whose unique and fascinating biology gives us insight into our own genetic makeup. </description>
What I want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.
The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.
If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems, they simply will not work.
That's the first thing.
The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal, if we study this mammal, we're going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses, such as blindness and deafness.
And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its DNA.
So are you all thinking?
So, magnificent creature, isn't it?
Who here thought of a bat?
Ah, I can see half the audience agrees with me, and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.
One fifth of all living mammals is a bat, and they have very unique attributes.
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about 64 million years.
One of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly.
Now flight is an inherently difficult thing.
Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times: once in the bats, once in the birds, and once in the pterodactyls.
And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.
But one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment. They use echolocation.
Now, what I mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose. This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment, and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image.
And this enables them to orient in complete darkness.
Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.
Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.
Indeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel once said, "To truly experience an alien life form on this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."
And if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat, you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it.
Very big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.
So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize sound is very important for its survival.
Most bats look like the previous one.
However, there are a group that do not use echolocation.
They do not perceive their environment using sound, and these are the flying foxes.
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia, you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and if you just look at their face, you can see they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.
So among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception.
Now this is going to be important for what I'm going to tell you later during the talk.
Now, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you, and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats, that's probably not that surprising, because here in Western culture, bats have been demonized.
Really, of course the famous book "Dracula," written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker, probably is mainly responsible for this.
However, I also think it's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night, and we don't really understand them. We're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us.
Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.
They are the perpetrators in horror movies, such as this famous "Nightwing."
Also, if you think about it, demons always have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically -- or angels have bird wings.
Now, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture, that they perceive bats as creatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk into a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.
This is considered the Five Blessings.
The Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word for "happiness," and they believe that bats bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.
And indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats.
And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.
So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?
Now as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. And why is this?
Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.
They also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry in Mexico. So indeed, we need them for our ecosystems to function properly.
Without them, it's going to be a problem.
But most bats are voracious insect predators.
It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony of big brown bats, that they will feed on over a million insects a year, and in the United States of America, right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.
It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out populations of bats, and scientists have estimated that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.
They're going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone.
Now how can this help us?
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation, we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops.
And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars, if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.
They maintain the health of our ecosystems, and also they save us money.
So again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important for our ecosystems.
And what about the second? What about health?
Inside every cell in your body lies your genome.
Your genome is made up of your DNA, your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are.
Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies, it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.
Now when we've been doing this, we've realized that there's variations within our genome.
So I want you to look at the person beside you.
Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.
And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases, or does this variation just make you different?
Again, what does it mean here? What does this variation actually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate between the two. So how do we do this?
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.
So through natural selection, over time, mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time.
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.
And so therefore, if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is, i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function, for its survival, it will be the same in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.
So therefore, if we were to do this, what we'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same or if it's different. So if it is the same, this indicates that that site is important for a function, so a disease mutation should fall within that site.
So in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow-type genome at that site, it probably suggests that purple is bad.
This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently.
So say, for example, the region of the genome that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well, such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well have the purple type, we know that this is probably what's causing this disease.
So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses.
We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and 45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem, and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases, so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease.
Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000 newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80, over half of us will also have a hearing problem.
Again, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.
is looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats, and we have looked at genes that cause blindness when there's a defect in them, genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them, and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.
So bats are also important for our health, to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.
So this is where we are right now, but what about the future?
What about longevity?
This is where we're going to go, and as I said before, I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome.
So why should we be interested in aging at all?
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood, aspects of all of biology, and really, since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.
In Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65, and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.
As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration causes problems for our society, so we have to address it.
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for?
Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years?
Nobody? One? How about 10 years?
Some? How about 30?
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.
This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.
It lived for up to 42 years, and this bat's still alive in the wild today.
But what would be so amazing about this?
Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship between body size, metabolic rate, and how long you can live for, and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size.
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young.
Think of a mouse. But bats are very different.
As you can see here on this graph, in blue, these are all other mammals, but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really, really high metabolic rate, and the question is, how can they do that?
There are 19 species of mammal that live longer than expected, given their body size, than man, and 18 of those are bats.
So therefore, they must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses, particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size, but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.
So right now, in my lab, we're combining state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date, modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.
And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.
Aging is a big problem for humanity, and I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out what they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy, we can enable us to do the same thing.
Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.
Just imagine what that would be like.
So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem, they allow us to understand how our genome functions, and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.
So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal, I want you to smile. Thank you.

<title>Rives: If I controlled the Internet</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How many poets could cram eBay, Friendster and Monster.com into 3-minute poem worthy of a standing ovation? Enjoy Rives' unique talent.</description>
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television, "I'm really getting into the Internet lately.
I just wish it were more organized."
So ...
If I controlled the Internet, you could auction your broken heart on eBay.
Take the money; go to Amazon; buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.
If I were in charge of the Internet, you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.
Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied, U-turn on silent treatment, all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.
Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan, but I still stretch miles in all directions.
If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website.
That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you're really just chattin' with your pals.
Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.
They would not email you back -- but you'd get an automated reply.
Their name in your inbox -- it's all you wanted anyway.
And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.
Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy.
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."
If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword, trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.
I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges."
Now follow me, OK?
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.
One, two, three.
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather.
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom, who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges, who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far.
So if I were emperor of the Internet, I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?
But at that point, I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis -- so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.
I wouldn't need it.
I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me, I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop! -- I'd go wireless.
Huh? Maybe Google would hire this.
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee, you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?
I guess it's just like life.
It is not a question of if you can -- it's: do ya?
We can interfere with the interface.
We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on.
You don't say a prayer.
You don't write a psalm.
You don't chant an "om."
You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
Thank you, TED.

<title>Bill Davenhall: Your health depends on where you live</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Where you live: It impacts your health as much as diet and genes do, but it's not part of your medical records. At TEDMED, Bill Davenhall shows how overlooked government geo-data can mesh with mobile GPS apps to keep doctors in the loop. Call it "geo-medicine."</description>
Can geographic information make you healthy?
In 2001 I got hit by a train.
My train was a heart attack.
I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward, recuperating from emergency surgery.
And I suddenly realized something: that I was completely in the dark.
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"
"Why now?" "Why here?"
"Could my doctor have warned me?"
So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.
Genetics, lifestyle and environment.
That's going to sort of contain our risks, and if we manage those risks we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.
Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.
And you know why I understand that?
Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this.
Have you ever had to fill out those long, legal-size forms in your doctor's office?
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?
Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history, your medication history, your surgical history, your allergy history ... did I forget any history?
But this part of the equation I didn't really get, and I don't think my physicians really get this part of the equation.
What does that mean, my environment?
Well, it can mean a lot of things.
This is my life. These are my life places.
We all have these.
While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about: How many places have you lived?
Just think about that, you know, wander through your life thinking about this.
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.
And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place.
So, it's not really simple when somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work, and where do you spend all your time?
And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see?"
Well, when I have done this on myself, I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places.
And I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time, even though I'm an extensive global trekker.
Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.
I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania, but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs.
You know, breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and methane gas, in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.
And if you've been in that part of the country, this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.
So then I decided to leave that part of the world, and I was going to go to the mid-west.
OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.
Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.
They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene.
Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now, breathing various concentrations of that.
And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.
It was insidious and it was really happening.
Then I decided I had to get really smart, I would take this job in the West Coast.
And I moved to Redlands California.
Very nice, and there my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them, I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.
Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.
Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day.
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.
So, what's wrong with this picture?
Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.
The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office: They never ask me about my place history.
No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me, "Where have you lived?"
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach.
They really don't do that. It's missing.
Look at the kind of data that's available.
This data's from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.
Now, I've circled the places where I've been.
Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack I'd been in the right places. Right?
So, how many people are in the white?
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space?
Anybody? Boy you're lucky.
How many have spent it in the red places?
Oh, not so lucky.
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world.
They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck.
But none of that's in my medical record.
And it's not in yours either.
So, here's my friend Paul.
He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours, 24/7, 365 days out of the year for the last two years, everywhere he went.
And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.
And this is where he has spent most of his time.
If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do.
Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.
We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA.
Did you know that data existed?
For every community in the United States, you could have your own personalized map of that.
So, our cell phones can now build a place history.
This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.
This might be what we end up with.
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?
This could be my little assessment.
And he looks at that and he says, "Whoa Bill, I suggest that maybe you not decide, just because you're out here in beautiful California, and it's warm every day, that you get out and run at six o'clock at night.
I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill, because of this report."
What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.
Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information.
It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this.
And they're in the early stages of development.
These programs need to be supported, and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today.
The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record, we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record.
It not only will be important for the physician; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon.
But it will also be useful for us.
I could have made the decision, if I had this information, not to move to the ozone capital of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.
Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company.
With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago.
Just look at that for a minute.
That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about, was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness, and how our healthcare system actually operates.
That was what he was talking about on that quote.
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.
So, I'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.
So with that, I'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health: Geography always matters.
And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.

<title>Jamie Heywood: The big idea my brother inspired</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When Jamie Heywood's brother was diagnosed with ALS, he devoted his life to fighting the disease as well. The Heywood brothers built an ingenious website where people share and track data on their illnesses -- and they discovered that the collective data had enormous power to comfort, explain and predict.</description>
When my brother called me in December of 1998, he said, "The news does not look good."
This is him on the screen.
He'd just been diagnosed with ALS, which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.
It paralyzes you. It starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord.
And you go from being a healthy, robust 29-year-old male to someone that cannot breathe, cannot move, cannot speak.
This has actually been, to me, a gift, because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life.
And even though Steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family.
We did not even -- I think adversity is not even the right word.
We looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way."
And I want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do, which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.
Because, as we all know here today, it doesn't work very well.
I want to talk about it in the context of a story.
This is the story of my brother.
But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story, and go to something more.
"Given my status, what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"
is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.
And those questions all have variables to them.
All of our statuses are different.
All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish, is different, and our paths will be different, they are all stories.
But it's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do, this concept we had, was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"
and go from this concept of walking, breathing, and then his hands, speak, and ultimately happiness and function.
So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man on his icon, but the rest of them are really what's important here.
Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed, as he was in that pool, he could not walk, he could not use his arms -- that's why he had the little floaty things on them, did you see those? -- he was happy. We were at the beach, he was raising his son, and he was productive.
And we took this, and we converted it into data.
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.
It is a data point of Steven in a context.
Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy, as a builder: taller, stronger, got all the women, amazing guy.
Here he is walking down the aisle, but he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.
And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes, can't feed himself.
And here he is, paralyzed completely, unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.
These stories of his life, converted to data.
He renovated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak, and unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.
So, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.
And this is the insight, the thing that we are excited about, because we have gone away from the community that we are, the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.
We need to give to others to be successful.
So, Steven is sharing this story, but he is not alone.
There are so many other people sharing their stories.
Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.
And we convert that information into this structure, this understanding, this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable, to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered.
We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression, Parkinson's disease, HIV.
These are not simple, they are not internet scalable; they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease.
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.
And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me, the company that myself, my youngest brother and a good friend from MIT started.
Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now, sharing their stories as data.
Here is an M.S. patient.
His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.
Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.
Each of them can have a different characteristic.
You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.
Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.
It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.
But he is working to keep his CD4 count high and his viral level low so he can make his life better.
But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.
Look at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.
These are patients currently on drugs, sharing data.
I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.
Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.
These are why people pray.
Here is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.
So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day, and see if they're doing better, they probably are.
Here they are. It's an open network, everybody is sharing. We can see it all.
Or, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.
And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.
How they treat it, the drugs, the components of it, their side effects, all of it in a rich environment, and you can drill down and see the individuals.
This amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for -- 1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.
I want to talk to the 58 patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day.
And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years.
So, you can see the duration.
All open, all available.
I'm going to log in.
And this is my brother's profile.
And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.
This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.
And you can see here, as this animates over, Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients, against this information.
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile, that he has non-genetic ALS.
You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs, but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.
Wait, poor spinal capacity.
Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program?
Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money?
Detrol. In the side effects for his drug, integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had, the first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.
I love here -- the cyberkinetics implant, which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.
You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.
So, you click down on the ALS tab there.
I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.
I can look at my constipation, how to manage it.
I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they're meaningful.
But I want more.
I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this data and make something even better.
I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs, and all of the things that interact among those, the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it, so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is.
I don't even know what a medical record is.
I want to solve a problem. I want an application.
So, can I take this data -- rearrange yourself, put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top, tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else, and what interacts.
Years after he's had these drugs, I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva, including some positive side effects that came from other drugs, were making his constipation worse.
And if anyone's ever had severe constipation, and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life -- yes, that was a pun.
You're trying to manage these, and this grid is available here, and we want to understand it.
No one's ever had this kind of information.
So, patients have this. We're for patients.
This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.
This is about the patients.
So, how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?
And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said, "What's something we can use all the time, that we can use in the medical care system, that everyone will understand?"
So, the patients print it out, because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network.
It's actually the most used feature on the website.
Doctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.
So, we went from this story of Steven and his history to data, and then back to paper, where we went back and engaged the medical care system.
And here's another paper.
This is a journal, PNAS -- I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America.
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about the amazing things they've done.
This is a report about a drug called lithium.
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder, that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.
Now, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.
But the short story is: If you're a patient, you want to be on the blue line.
You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.
Because the blue line is a better line. The red line is way downhill, the blue line is a good line.
So, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also is that people always accuse these Internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.
So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.
Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data in a bad publication.
And they call the Internet irresponsible.
Here's the implication of what happens.
There's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil, who unfortunately passed away nine months ago, who said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?
Because I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.
I want to know now. Can you help us?"
So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.
We let them share the data and exchange it.
You know, a data network.
And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM, can you guys tell us whether this works or not?"
And we went around and we talked to people, and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?
You don't have the blinding, you don't have data, it doesn't follow the scientific method.
It's never going to work. You can't do it."
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."
I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients, but I can say whether it works in Humberto.
I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over, and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool, you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer, and find everything you've lost, and I loved it.
And I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients, except instead of going backwards, we go forwards.
Can we find out what's going to happen to you, so that you can maybe change it?"
So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto, That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time to build our own. This is a real app by the way.
This is not just graphics.
And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring their data together. And we bring their histories into it.
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"
So, we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points, integrated across everything we know about the patient.
Full information, the entire course of their disease.
And that's what is going to happen to Humberto, unless he does something.
And he took lithium, and he went down the line.
And it works almost every time.
Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.
But almost all the time it works.
It's actually scary. It's beautiful.
So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.
But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.
And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.
But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium.
These are all the patients that started lithium.
It's the Intent to Treat Curve.
You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones, those are the people in the study in PNAS that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones, the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.
And the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero, going forward, and then going backward.
So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.
Terrifyingly accurate matching.
And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
You're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly, but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
But you know, a lot of people dropped out, the trial, there is too much drop out.
Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium, because they were so convinced they were getting better?
We asked our control algorithm, are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial -- can we look at those patients and say, "Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them, and what happens?"
Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly.
Those little lines? That's the power.
So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you that for those 69 people that took lithium, they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them, just like me, and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.
We did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH for millions of dollars failed for futility last week, and announced it.
So, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.
I never really knew whether it worked.
And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna, in his lumbar cord, and filled out the IRBs and did all this work, and I never really knew.
How did I not know?
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.
I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group -- we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.
And there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.
And some of them were available. So, we hired one.
We hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.
I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him, is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said, "Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant worked or not?"
And he sent me this two days ago.
It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?
We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.
Because something went different.
But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.
It only works about 12 months.
It's the first version of the time machine.
First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later but 12 months so far.
And, you know, I look at this, and I get really emotional.
You look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls, you can look at them, you can ask them.
And I found a woman that had -- we found her, she was odd because she had data after she died.
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores, because he knew how much she cared.
And I am thankful.
I can't believe that these people, years after my brother had died, helped me answer the question about whether an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on years ago, worked or not.
I wished it had been there when I'd done it the first time, and I'm really excited that it's here now, because the lab that I founded has some data on a drug that might work, and I'd like to show it.
I'd like to show it in real time, now, and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.
I've got to thank the 45,000 people that are doing this social experiment with us.
There is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again, to be part of community again, to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable, and it's very exciting. So, thank you.

<title>Kirby Ferguson: Embrace the remix</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nothing is original, says Kirby Ferguson, creator of Everything is a Remix. From Bob Dylan to Steve Jobs, he says our most celebrated creators borrow, steal and transform.</description>
We're going to begin in 1964.
Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career is just reaching its pinnacle.
He's been christened the voice of a generation, and he's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate, but there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.
2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, takes the Beatles' "White Album," combines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album" to create "The Grey Album."
"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online, and the Beatles' record company sends out countless cease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property."
Now, "The Grey Album" is a remix.
It is new media created from old media.
It was made using these three techniques: copy, transform and combine.
It's how you remix. You take existing songs, you chop them up, you transform the pieces, you combine them back together again, and you've got a new song, but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs.
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing.
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.
I think everything is a remix, and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.
All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from.
We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.
All right, this first song you're going to hear is "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.
After that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."
Jean Ritchie: ♫ In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, ♫ ♫ not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. ♫ Bob Dylan: ♫ Come you masters of war, ♫ ♫ you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, ♫ ♫ You that build all the bombs. ♫ Kirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game," by Dominic Behan. Alongside that, you're going to hear "With God on Our Side," by Dylan.
Dominic Behan: ♫ Come all ye young rebels, ♫ ♫ and list while I sing, ♫ ♫ for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. ♫ BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫ ♫ my age it means less, ♫ ♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫ KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it, then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain, he just thought it was his song.
Last one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons," another traditional folk tune.
Alongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."
This one's more about the lyric.
Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫ ♫ darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. ♫ BD: ♫ It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫ ♫ if you don't know by now, ♫ ♫ and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫ ♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫ KF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these.
It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.
This is pretty typical among folk singers.
Here's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.
"The worlds are the important thing.
Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune, sing high when they sing low, sing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."
And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here, and I'm sure you all recognize the results.
We know this tune, right? We know it?
Actually you don't.
That is "When the World's on Fire," a very old melody, in this case performed by the Carter Family.
Guthrie adapted it into "This Land Is Your Land."
So, Bob Dylan, like all folk singers, he copied melodies, he transformed them, he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff.
Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others.
Instead, these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property.
Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on, and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared.
Henry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable."
2007. The iPhone makes it debut.
Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early, but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades.
That's multi-touch, controlling a device by touching its display.
Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch and making a rather foreboding joke.
Steve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch.
You can do multi-fingered gestures on it, and boy have we patented it.
KF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.
This is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.
This is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.
It's the same animal, at least.
Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology.
Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything -- isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s.
The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.
KF: So he's pretty frank about it not being new.
So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.
It's the small parts of it that are, and it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent: to promote the progress of useful arts.
Here is the first ever slide-to-unlock.
That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this.
It's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger.
I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.
Now, can someone own this idea?
Now, back in the '80s, there were no software patents, and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.
What if they had patented pop-up menus, scrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper?
Would a young and inexperienced Apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like Xerox?
Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed.
For example ...
SJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying.
He said, "Good artists copy. Great artists steal."
And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.
KF: Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.
"I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product."
"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."
Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.
Now, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion We have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours.
We have no such aversion towards copying what other people have, because we do that nonstop.
So here's the sort of equation we're looking at.
We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property, plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases, plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court, plus cognitive biases against perceived loss.
And the sum looks like this.
That is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones.
Is this promoting the progress of useful arts?
1983. Bob Dylan is 42 years old, and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past.
He records a song called "Blind Willie McTell," named after the blues singer, and the song is a voyage through the past, through a much darker time, but a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell had few illusions about what they did.
"I jump 'em from other writers but I arrange 'em my own way."
I think this is mostly what we do.
Our creativity comes from without, not from within.
We are not self-made. We are dependent on one another, and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness.
It's a liberation from our misconceptions, and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin.
Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

<title>Gary Wolf: The quantified self</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TED@Cannes, Gary Wolf gives a 5-min intro to an intriguing new pastime: using mobile apps and always-on gadgets to track and analyze your body, mood, diet, spending -- just about everything in daily life you can measure -- in gloriously geeky detail.</description>
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night.
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute -- my blood pressure, 127 over 74.
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday, so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine, zero of alcohol.
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index, or the NPI-16, is a reassuring 0.31.
We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search.
I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect, learn, remember and want to improve.
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day.
People were tracking their food via Twitter, their kids' diapers on their iPhone.
They were making detailed journals of their spending, their mood, their symptoms, their treatments.
Now, we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices, the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing, and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer.
It tracks your movement through space.
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece, and they're going into all kinds of devices.
But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this.
This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device -- among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit.
This tracks your activity and also your sleep.
It has just that sensor in it.
You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.
It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell.
And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor.
This is the strap that people use to transmit heart-rate data to their Nike+ system.
This is a beautiful, new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data, not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep -- deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.
The rest of it is the bedside console; just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago -- I mean, really until now.
And this is the sleep tracking system of today.
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C.
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler, but the top is a very small GPS transceiver, which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident, giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors.
Now, we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world -- these tiny sensors that gather data in nature, the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used, and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute.
But we think of these tools as pointing outward, as windows and I'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors.
So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement, we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement, for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.
Here's a biometric device: a pair of Apple Earbuds.
Last year, Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation, heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.
What is this for?
What should it be for?
Some people will say it's for biometric security.
Some people will say it's for public health research.
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.
I'd like to tell you that it's also for self-knowledge.
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.
The self is just our operation center, our consciousness, our moral compass.
So, if we want to act more effectively in the world, we have to get to know ourselves better.
Thank you.

<title>JR: My wish: Use art to turn the world inside out</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: JR, a semi-anonymous French street artist, uses his camera to show the world its true face, by pasting photos of the human face across massive canvases. At TED2011, he makes his audacious TED Prize wish: to use art to turn the world inside out. Learn more about his work and learn how you can join in at insideoutproject.net.</description>
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris, and the phone rang and I heard, "Hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011.
You have to make a wish to save the world."
I was lost.
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.
The world is fucked up.
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world, population is growing by millions, there's no more fish in the sea, the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said, we're all becoming fat.
Except maybe French people.
Whatever.
So I called back and I told her, "Look, Amy, tell the TED guys I just won't show up.
I can't do anything to save the world."
She said, "Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."
"Oh, all right."
"That's cool."
I mean, technology, politics, business do change the world -- not always in a good way, but they do.
What about art?
Could art change the world?
I started when I was 15 years old.
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.
I was doing graffiti -- writing my name everywhere, using the city as a canvas.
I was going in the tunnels of Paris, on the rooftops with my friends.
Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure.
It was like leaving our mark on society, to say, "I was here," on the top of a building.
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway, I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size.
That's how, at 17 years old, I started pasting them.
And I did my first "expo de rue," which means sidewalk gallery.
And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising.
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people.
I would control it directly with the public in the streets.
So that's Paris.
I would change -- depending on the places I would go -- the title of the exhibition.
That's on the Champs-Elysees.
I was quite proud of that one.
Because I was just 18 and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.
Then when the photo left, the frame was still there.
November 2005: the streets are burning.
A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris.
Everyone was glued to the TV, watching disturbing, frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood.
I mean, these kids, without control, throwing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops.
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous, destroying their own environment.
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? -- my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car -- a pasting I'd done a year earlier -- an illegal one -- still there.
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.
I know those guys.
All of them are not angels, but they're not monsters either.
So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens.
It was the only one I had at that time.
But with that lens, you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.
So you can do it only with their trust.
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves.
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name, age, even building number of these guys.
A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.
And we go from thug images, who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image.
That's where I realized the power of paper and glue.
So could art change the world?
A year later, I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict.
I mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.
So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.
Are they so different?
When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media.
So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel.
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other.
I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall.
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.
We called the project Face 2 Face.
The experts said, "No way.
The people will not accept.
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."
I love the way that people will ask me, "How big will my photo be?"
"It will be as big as your house."
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.
So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough.
And so Palestinians guys say, "Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."
So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper.
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life.
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.
We're in Ramallah right now.
We're pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.
People come around us and start asking, "What are you doing here?"
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."
And then there was always a silence.
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face -- doing a face -- right here?"
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."
And I would always leave that moment, and we would ask them, "So can you tell me who is who?"
And most of them couldn't say.
We even pasted on Israeli military towers, and nothing happened.
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that, I agree -- but the people in the street, they are the curator.
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.
They are not meant to stay.
But exactly four years after, the photos, most of them are still there.
Face 2 Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible -- and, you know what, even easy.
We didn't push the limit; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.
In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places without [many] museums.
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting.
So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums.
When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets.
So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos.
I called that project Women Are Heroes.
When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents, I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict.
I just observed.
Sometimes there was no words, no sentence, just tears.
I just took their pictures and pasted them.
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.
Most of the places I went to, I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media.
So for example, in June 2008, I was watching TV in Paris, and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro -- the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers.
And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces.
I was shocked.
All Brazil was shocked.
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas, because the largest drug cartel controls it.
So I decided to go there.
When I arrived -- I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing -- no eyewitnesses.
So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book.
And she said, "You know what?
We're hungry for culture.
We need culture out there."
So I went out and I started with the kids.
I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.
But that's okay.
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square and some women came.
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend -- they all wanted to shout the story.
After that day, everyone in the favela gave me the green light.
I took more photos, and we started the project.
The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, "You know what?
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.
You see that enough in the media.
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.
I've been seeing it around me the last few days."
So that's a really symbolic pasting, because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.
And that's where the three kids got arrested, and that's the grandmother of one of them.
And on that stairs, that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire.
Everyone there understood the project.
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.
I mean, you should see that.
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.
And they would put a number: "Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia."
We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know.
So how can we know about the project?
So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them.
So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women.
We kept traveling.
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya.
In war-torn places like Monrovia, people come straight to you.
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"
Art. Just doing art.
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?
Don't you have color in France?"
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say, "You know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.
During that time, you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow.
This is art."
I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects.
And then it becomes more.
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.
On this bridge that's in Monrovia, ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war.
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict.
This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa.
You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008.
This time we covered the roofs of the houses, but we didn't use paper, because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house -- vinyl does.
Then art becomes useful.
So the people kept it.
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there are so [many] houses inside.
And I went there a few months ago -- photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.
So I asked the people what happened.
"Oh, that guy just moved."
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke, "Now God can see me."
When you look at Kibera now, they look back.
Okay, India.
Before I start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos -- we're a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls.
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.
In India it was just impossible to paste.
I heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting.
So we decided to paste white, white on the walls.
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.
So people would come to us and ask us, "Hey, what are you up to?"
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"
Of course, they were confused.
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker.
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves.
Thank you.
So we didn't get caught this time.
Each project -- that's a film from Women Are Heroes.
Okay.
For each project we do a film.
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" -- its images, photography, taken one after the other.
And the photos kept traveling even without us.
Hopefully, you'll see the film, and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos.
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.
Behind each image is a story.
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left.
For example, we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get.
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.
We did that in most of the places.
We go back regularly.
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela, we have a cultural center running there.
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project said, "Hey, what about my roof?"
So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project.
A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.
So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects.
And that is for me one of the more important things in the work.
I think, today, as important as the result is the way you do things.
And that has always been a central part of the work.
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising.
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks.
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.
But yesterday the city called them and said, "Look, you're going to have to tear it down.
Because this can be taken for advertising, and because of the law, it has to be taken down."
But tell me, advertising for what?
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community.
But they asked me for a promise basically.
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."
So I did. That's Paris.
That's Rio.
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.
You understand the full scope of the project.
That's London.
New York.
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.
All right, recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore.
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt, Giacomelli, other people's artwork.
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.
The importance is what you do with the images, the statement it makes where it's pasted.
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in Southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.
In some ways, art can change the world.
Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions.
Art can change the way we see the world.
Art can create an analogy.
Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world.
When I do my work, I have two kinds of reactions.
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.
They would be really useful."
Or, "How can we help?"
I presume that you belong to the second category, and that's good, because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them.
So now my wish is: I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together we'll turn the world inside out.
And this starts right now.
Yes, everyone in the room.
Everyone watching.
I wanted that wish to actually start now.
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for.
Take the photos, the portraits, upload it -- I'll give you all the details -- and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world.
The full data is on the website -- insideoutproject.net -- that is launching today.
What we see changes who we are.
When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.
So I hope that, together, we'll create something that the world will remember.
And this starts right now and depends on you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

<title>Suzanne Lee: Grow your own clothes</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Designer Suzanne Lee shares her experiments in growing a kombucha-based material that can be used like fabric or vegetable leather to make clothing. The process is fascinating, the results are beautiful and the potential is simply stunning.</description>
So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this, or this, or maybe this.
But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this -- green tea, sugar, a few microbes and a little time.
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe, which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms, which spin cellulose in a fermentation process.
Over time, these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface.
So we start by brewing the tea.
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time, and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath.
We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
And then we're ready to add the living organism.
And along with that, some acetic acid.
And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid.
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it.
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.
So this is my mini fabric farm.
After about three days, the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose.
And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface.
After about two to three weeks, we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.
So the bath on the left is after five days, and on the right, after 10.
And this is a static culture.
You don't have to do anything to it; you just literally watch it grow.
It doesn't need light.
And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold, soapy water.
At this point, it's really heavy.
It's over 90 percent water, so we need to let that evaporate.
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.
Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air.
And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.
And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together, forming seams.
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me.
Since it's organic, I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.
I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation.
Using fruit and vegetable staining, create organic patterning.
And using indigo, make it anti-microbial.
And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark.
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose, it just takes one, and a really short one at that.
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.
So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today, I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water.
The dress would get really heavy, and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked.
Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.
What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need.
So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread.
Align it in this direction.
Make it hydrophobic.
And while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape."
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing, and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue.
But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire.
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting because then I start to think, wow, we could actually imagine growing consumable products.
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency.
So we only grow what we need.
There's no waste.
And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example, a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant.
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings.
What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton, leather or other textile materials.
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources.
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact.
We could, for example, imagine growing a lamp, a chair, a car or maybe even a house.
So I guess what my question to you is: in the future, what would you choose to grow?
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random.
This is one of the jackets you grew?
SL: Yes, it is.
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.
It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
Suzanne Lee.

<title>Michael Pollan: A plant's-eye view</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What if human consciousness isn't the end-all and be-all of Darwinism? What if we are all just pawns in corn's clever strategy game to rule the Earth? Author Michael Pollan asks us to see the world from a plant's-eye view.</description>
It's a simple idea about nature.
I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.
I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals, and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.
Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend.
And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested, looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.
It's not my idea, other people have hit on it, but I've tried to take it to some new places.
Let me tell you where I got it.
Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use, I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.
And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes, it was the first week of May -- this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom; they're just white clouds above.
I was here, planting my chunks, cutting up potatoes and planting it, and the bees were working on this tree; bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.
And one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration, you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking -- and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.
And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden, working alongside that bumblebee, was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?
How was our role in this garden similar and different?
And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common: both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another, and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots.
I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant -- I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was -- and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country, brought it, and I was planting it.
And that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided, "I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom, I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave."
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are; that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.
I plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.
But that day, it occurred to me: what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?
Because, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge, but we know better.
We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?
I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits -- color, scent, flavor, pattern -- that has lured that bee in.
And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar, and also picking up some powder on its leg, and going off to the next blossom.
The bee is not calling the shots.
And I realized then, I wasn't either.
I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.
And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology, but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us, figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.
The competition of grasses, right?
And suddenly everything looked different.
And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.
I had thought always -- and in fact, had written this in my first book; this was a book about gardening -- that lawns were nature under culture's boot, that they were totalitarian landscapes, and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex.
And that's what the lawn was.
But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.
I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees, who they compete with for sunlight."
And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back, which in New England happens very, very quickly.
So I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."
And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees -- that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry -- what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?
That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug, a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.
And that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?
Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit -- is what does it get us?
And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer, how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?
Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?
Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota, rather than its destruction?
And I would submit that this idea does this.
So, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way, besides some entertaining insights about human desire.
As an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly, which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...
Ugh. Mini-Me.
We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin, we figured out we are just one species among many; evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others; we are acted upon as well as acting; we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.
But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later; none of us really believes this.
We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes -- who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart; that the world is divided into subjects and objects; that there is nature on one side, culture on another.
As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view, you realize that the real literary conceit is that -- is the idea that nature is opposed to culture, the idea that consciousness is everything -- and that's another very important thing it does.
Looking at the world from other species' points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.
You suddenly realize that consciousness -- which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature, human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.
And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.
But, you know, there's a comedian who said, "Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?
Well, consciousness."
So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting.
I'll give you two examples, also from the garden: lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?
It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mite that comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.
So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language, they have biochemistry.
And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.
Their complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at, and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.
You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes and we came out with only 23,000.
Just to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.
So who's the more sophisticated species?
Well, we're all equally sophisticated.
We've been evolving just as long, just along different paths.
So, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.
And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller, is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically.
Now, the other use of this is practical.
And I'm going to take you to a farm right now, because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today, to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense.
It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.
So it helped me understand industrial agriculture, which of course is a Cartesian system.
It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want.
Let me take you to a very different kind of farm.
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.
I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented, and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.
And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm, and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.
And that is this: the farm is called Polyface, which means ...
the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants, growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.
It's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this, such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...
what else does he have?
All the six different species -- rabbits, actually -- are all performing ecological services for one another, such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another.
It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance, but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it, and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.
And I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?
And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see; this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion, the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning, and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.
So, one day, cattle in a pen.
The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing: relatively new, hooked to a car battery; even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.
Cows graze one day. They move, OK?
They graze everything down, intensive grazing.
He waits three days, and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens.
He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank, turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank -- clucking, gossiping as chickens will -- and they make a beeline for the cow patties.
And what they're doing is very interesting: they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.
And the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem.
But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens' favorite form of protein.
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs, and in the process they're spreading the manure out.
Very useful second ecosystem service.
And third, while they're in this paddock they are, of course, defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.
They then move out to the next one, and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.
And within four or five weeks, he can do it again.
He can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species, like the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.
Now, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.
So, it's a very productive system.
And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs; 20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits -- an immense amount of food.
You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
again, give each species what it wants, let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.
Put that in play.
But look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.
What happens to the grass when you do this?
When a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height, and it immediately does something very interesting.
Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio, and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots; they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.
And the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots, decomposing them -- the earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria -- and the result is new soil.
This is how soil is created.
It's created from the bottom up.
This is how the prairies were built, the relationship between bison and grasses.
And what I realized when I understood this -- and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer, he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer, because grass is really the keystone species of such a system -- is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads, which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.
More for us, less for nature.
Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season there is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity.
It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.
There are a lot of farmers doing this today.
This is well beyond organic agriculture, which is still a Cartesian system, more or less.
And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species, take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences, which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time -- that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process.
This is a way to reanimate the world, and that's what's so exciting about this perspective.
When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones, the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about.
Thank you very much.

<title>Steve Howard: Let's go all-in on selling sustainability</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The big blue buildings of Ikea have sprouted solar panels and wind turbines; inside, shelves are stocked with LED lighting and recycled cotton. Why? Because as Steve Howard puts it: “Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do.” Howard, the chief sustainability officer at the furniture megastore, talks about his quest to sell eco-friendly materials and practices -- both internally and to worldwide customers -- and lays a challenge for other global giants.</description>
I've spent my life working on sustainability.
I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group.
I worked on forestry issues in WWF.
I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system.
About 25 years in total, and then three years ago, I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team.
Like many people here, well, I want to maximize my personal impact in the world, so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.
But first, let's just take three numbers.
The first number is three: three billion people.
This is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030, coming out of poverty.
It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.
The second number is six: This is six degrees centigrade, what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.
We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.
And if you think about it, all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years, much of that is due to just one degree warming, and we need CO2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down.
It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.
The third number is 12: That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born.
You can see my grandmother there.
That was in the beginning of the last century.
So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England, the ninth largest city in the world.
Now there are 500 cities, nearly, with a million people or more in them.
And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050, that's the century when we build all the world's cities, the century that we're in the middle of right now.
Every other century was kind of practice, and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.
So think about it.
We're building cities like never before, bringing people out of poverty like never before, and changing the climate like never before.
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do.
it's about what we do right here, right now, and for the rest of our working lives.
So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do, and we have a sustainability strategy called "people and planet positive" to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.
Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business?
Other companies have sustainability strategies.
I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.
But first, let's think of customers.
We know from asking people from China to the U.S.
that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day-to-day issues, the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?
Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?
Then they care about big issues like climate change.
But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive, and they expect business to help, and they're a little bit disappointed today.
So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products.
We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.
We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.
And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.
So every time you pulled on a t-shirt, or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom, or sometimes all three together, you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.
It wasn't a great start.
Today we have choices.
We can make products that are beautiful or ugly, sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive, functional or useless.
So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable, sustainable products.
Let's take the LED.
The LED is the next best thing to daylight.
The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs -- I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes, wasting energy every time you switch them on -- change them after this -- or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not -- but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters.
They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.
They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.
Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side.
You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent.
And the best thing is, they'll also last for more than 20 years.
So think about that.
You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times, probably more if you're in this audience.
You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.
Your kids could go to school, go to college, go away and have kids of their own, come back, bring the grandkids, you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.
So LEDs are fantastic.
What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs, the halogens and the CFLs.
We decided, over the next two years, we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.
We will go all in.
And this is what business needs to do: go all-in, go 100 percent, because then you stop investing in the old stuff, you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs, you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy.
It's not just about products in people's homes.
We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products.
Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials, and we can and will go zero waste.
And there's opportunities in a circular economy.
But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.
Let's take cotton.
Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now.
It's a brilliant textile in use.
It's really dirty in production.
It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.
So we've worked with others, with other businesses and NGOs, on the Better Cotton Initiative, working right back down to the farm, and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs, the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports.
Yields increase, and you halve the input costs.
Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.
Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached, and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.
Again, we're going all-in.
By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.
Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.
People sometimes think that 100 percent's going to be hard, and we've had the conversation in the business.
Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent.
If you have a 90 percent target, everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the 10 percent.
When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear, and businesspeople like clarity, because then you just get the job done.
So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.
You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale, or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry that we can be proud of.
It's a simple choice, so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council, with literally hundreds of other organizations, and there's a point here about collaboration.
So hundreds of others, of NGOs, of forest workers' unions, and of businesses, have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council, which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground.
Now together, through our supply chain, with partners, we've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry.
That's about the size of Germany.
And we've decided in the next three years, we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business.
So be decisive on these issues.
Use your supply chain to drive good.
But then it comes to your operations.
Some things are certain, I think.
We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.
We know the sun will be shining somewhere, and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.
So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?
And why not take control of it ourselves?
So we're going 100 percent renewable.
By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business.
For all of our stores, our own factories, our distribution centers, we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far, and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate in six countries, and we're not done yet.
But think of a solar panel.
A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.
The electricity is free.
Every time the sun comes out after that, the electricity is free.
So this is a good thing for the CFO, not just the sustainability guy.
Every business can do things like this.
But then we've got to look beyond our operations, and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain.
Many businesses now, fortunately, have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains, but not every business. Far from it.
And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.
We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain, and people in the business were shocked.
And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.
So a code of conduct was developed, and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor.
But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor.
You've got to say that's not enough today.
I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable.
So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights?
We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights.
Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these, but actually in a survey, many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children.
So what we decided to do was, we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us, what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children?
We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015.
You know the phrase, you can manage what you measure?
Well, you should measure what you care about.
If you're not measuring things, you don't care and you don't know.
So let's take an example, measure the things that are important in your business.
Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women?
So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA that 47 percent are women today, but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management.
And we do not want to wait another hundred years.
So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA, and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.
So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years.
So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.
It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.
And everybody can do something on this as an individual.
Be a discerning consumer.
Vote with your wallets.
Search out the companies that are acting on this.
But also, there are other businesses already acting.
I mentioned renewable energy.
You go to Google or Lego, they're going 100 percent renewable too, in the same way that we are.
On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer.
But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.
We'll make mistakes going forward, but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent, having a dialogue with the right partners, and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.
So if you're a business leader, if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model, I'd urge you to do so.
And together, we can help create a sustainable world, and, if we get it right, we can make sustainability affordable for the many people, not a luxury for the few.
Thank you.

<title>Jon Nguyen: Tour the solar system from home</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Want to navigate the solar system without having to buy that expensive spacecraft? Jon Nguyen demos NASAJPL's "Eyes on the Solar System" -- free-to-use software for exploring the planets, moons, asteroids, and spacecraft that rotate around our sun in real-time. </description>
As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.
I would watch Nova on PBS.
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.
When I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor, he gave me a book for my birthday.
It was an astronomy book, and I poured over that thing for hours on end, and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was, I always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.
Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA, working for the jet propulsion laboratory, and there our team was challenged to create a 3D visualization of the solar system, and today I want to show you what we've done so far.
Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here you can do at home, because we built this for the public for you guys to use.
So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.
You can see the United States and California and San Diego, and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around.
Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before, but one thing we like to say in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.
We go from this view out to the stars.
So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show are the spacecraft, so I'm going to bring the interface back up, and now you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth.
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.
We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.
If we did, it would be a complete mess, because there's a lot of stuff out there.
And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.
So I'm going to find the International Space Station, double-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.
And now you're riding along with the ISS where it is right now.
And the other cool thing is, not only can we move the camera around, we can also control time, so I can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward, and now we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like, and they get one every 90 minutes.
All right, so what about the rest of it?
Well, I can click on this home button over here, and that will take us up to the inner solar system, and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.
You can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter, and while we're here, I want to point out something.
It's actually pretty busy.
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.
We have Dawn orbiting Vesta, and we have over here New Horizons on a straight shot to Pluto.
And I mention this because there's this strange public perception that NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.
Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration, and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.
Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment, well at least with our own launch vehicles, but NASA is far from dead, and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing.
Anyway, while we're here, again, if you want to visit anything, all you need to do is double-click.
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta, and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta, and this is happening right now.
I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.
You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.
And just being able to visit different places and go through different times, we have data from 1950 to 2050.
Granted, we don't have everything in between, because some of the data is hard to get.
Just being able to visit places in different times, you can explore this for hours, literally hours on end, but I want to show you one thing in particular, so I'm going to open up the destination tab, spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1, and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.
So now we've gone back in time.
We're now riding along with Voyager 1.
The date here is November 11, 1980.
Now, there's a funny thing going on here.
It doesn't look like anything's going on.
It looks like I've paused the program.
It's actually running at real rate right now, one second per second, and in fact, Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.
It only looks like nothing's moving because, well, Saturn here is 700,000 miles away, and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.
It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.
But to make it more interesting, I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch as Voyager 1 flies by Titan, which is a hazy moon of Saturn.
It actually has a very thick atmosphere.
And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.
I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.
There's a point to be made here.
With a 3D visualization like this, we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.
There's a whole story to tell here.
And even better, because it's an interactive application, you can tell the story for yourself.
If you want to pause it, you can pause it.
If you want to keep going, if you want to change the camera angle, you can do that, and because of that, I can show you that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.
It actually flies underneath Saturn.
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn, Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system, so if I just keep letting this go, you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.
And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.
I'm going to go back to today, now, and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.
Right there, above, way above the solar system, way beyond our solar system.
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.
Now you know why, and to me, that's the point of this program.
You can manipulate it yourself.
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp."
Well, we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp — — and we hope once it's there, you'll be able to learn for yourself what we've done out there, and what we're about to do.
And my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired, as I was as a kid, to pursue STEM education and to pursue a dream in space exploration.
Thank you.

<title>Sebastian Seung: I am my connectome</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Sebastian Seung is mapping a massively ambitious new model of the brain that focuses on the connections between each neuron. He calls it our "connectome," and it's as individual as our genome -- and understanding it could open a new way to understand our brains and our minds.</description>
We live in in a remarkable time, the age of genomics.
Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.
Your sequence and mine are slightly different.
That's why we look different.
I've got brown eyes; you might have blue or gray.
But it's not just skin-deep.
The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases, maybe even shape our personality, or give us mental disorders.
Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies.
And yet, I would like to think that I am more than my genes.
What do you guys think?
Are you more than your genes?
Yes?
I think some people agree with me.
I think we should make a statement.
I think we should say it all together.
All right: "I'm more than my genes" -- all together.
Everybody: I am more than my genes.
Sebastian Seung: What am I?
I am my connectome.
Now, since you guys are really great, maybe you can humor me and say this all together too.
Right. All together now.
Everybody: I am my connectome.
SS: That sounded great.
You know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is, and you're willing to play along with me.
I could just go home now.
Well, so far only one connectome is known, that of this tiny worm.
Its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons.
And in the 1970s and '80s, a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons.
In this diagram, every node is a neuron, and every line is a connection.
This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans.
Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections.
There's a diagram like this for your brain, but there's no way it would fit on this slide.
Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters.
That's a lot of information.
What's in that information?
We don't know for sure, but there are theories.
Since the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories -- the information that makes you, you -- maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain's neurons.
And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity -- maybe your personality and your intellect -- maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons.
And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis: I am my connectome.
I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true; I just want you to remember it.
And in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct, because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it.
Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor.
And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own, we need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated, that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.
And in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies, which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators.
Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.
You can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes.
They extend long and delicate branches, and in short, they look like trees.
But this is just a single neuron.
In order to find connectomes, we have to see all the neurons at the same time.
So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri, who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University.
Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain.
And we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times to obtain the resolution, so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.
Except, you still may not really recognize them, and that's because we have to work in three dimensions.
If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up, we get a three-dimensional image.
And still, you may not see the branches.
So we start at the top, and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red, and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice.
And we keep on doing that, slice after slice.
If we continue through the entire stack, we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.
And we can do that for another neuron in green.
And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations, and these are what are called synapses.
Let's zoom in on one synapse, and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.
You should see small circles -- these are called vesicles.
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
And so when the green neuron wants to communicate, it wants to send a message to the red neuron, it spits out neurotransmitter.
At the synapse, the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone.
So you see how to find a synapse.
How can we find an entire connectome?
Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.
We color every neuron in, in a different color, and then we look through all of the images, find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.
If we can do that throughout all the images, we could find a connectome.
Now, at this point, you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.
And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience: how are the brains of men and women different?
According to this self-help book, guys brains are like waffles; they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.
Girls' brains are like spaghetti; everything in their life is connected to everything else.
You guys are laughing, but you know, this book changed my life.
But seriously, what's wrong with this?
You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement?
It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl, everyone's brains are like spaghetti.
Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.
Just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate, one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches.
One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons, because there can be synapses at these points of contact.
By now, you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.
And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.
I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.
So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.
And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube.
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain.
So when show my friends this, sometimes they've told me, "You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.
Neuroscience is hopeless."
Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye, you don't really see how complex it is, but when you use a microscope, finally the hidden complexity is revealed.
In the 17th century, the mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal, wrote of his dread of the infinite, his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space.
And, as a scientist, I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings -- too much information, professor.
But may I?
I feel curiosity, and I feel wonder, but at times I have also felt despair.
Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite?
It's absurd.
How could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this?
And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.
And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.
Someday, a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images.
And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome.
I do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day, because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.
It will take the work of generations to succeed.
At the present time, my collaborators and I, what we're aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.
But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome.
For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis, that it's actually worth taking seriously.
As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood, your personal identity changes slowly.
Likewise, every connectome changes over time.
What kinds of changes happen?
Well, neurons, like trees, can grow new branches, and they can lose old ones.
Synapses can be created, and they can be eliminated.
And synapses can grow larger, and they can grow smaller.
Second question: what causes these changes?
Well, it's true.
To some extent, they are programmed by your genes.
But that's not the whole story, because there are signals, electrical signals, that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch.
These signals are called neural activity.
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions, our mental experiences.
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change.
And if you put those two facts together, it means that your experiences can change your connectome.
And that's why every connectome is unique, even those of genetically identical twins.
The connectome is where nature meets nurture.
And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering.
What's in this picture?
A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.
What else is in this picture?
Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed.
Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.
And with the stream, I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity.
Neural activity is constantly changing.
It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.
The connections of the brain's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows.
And so the connectome is like bed of the stream; but the metaphor is richer than that, because it's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water, but over long timescales, the water also reshapes the bed of the stream.
And as I told you just now, neural activity can change the connectome.
And if you'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights, I will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think -- of thoughts, feelings and perceptions.
And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness.
Neural activity is its water, and the connectome is its bed.
So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science.
Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work.
How will we go about testing the hypothesis "I am my connectome?"
Well, I propose a direct test.
Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes.
Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements, like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.
According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century, such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.
Because, if the first neurons in the chain are activated, through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons, which are activated, and so on down the line, like a chain of falling dominoes.
And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements.
So one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes.
But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.
They're going to be scrambled up.
So we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain.
And if we can do that, the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall.
And if that were successful, that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.
What a mess -- have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this?
I hope not.
But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.
The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.
Can anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?
I'll give you a hint. It's a big number.
I estimate, millions of miles, all packed in your skull.
And if you appreciate that number, you can easily see there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.
And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like, "Anorexic brains are wired differently," or "Autistic brains are wired differently."
These are plausible claims, but in truth, we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true.
And so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis-wiring of the brain, to see mental disorders in connectomes.
Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication.
Philosophers know this game very well.
If you believe that I am my connectome, I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome.
I mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species.
One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics.
If you pay 100,000 dollars, you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse, awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you.
Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality, calling them fools?
Or will they someday chuckle over our graves?
I don't know -- I prefer to test their beliefs, scientifically.
I propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain.
We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing.
The question is: has that damage erased the connectome?
If it has, there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.
Resurrection might succeed for the body, but not for the mind.
On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact, we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.
I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small, and propels us to the world of the far future.
Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history.
As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors on the African savanna, what distinguished us was our larger brains.
We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies.
Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains.
I believe that this voyage of self-discovery is not just for scientists, but for all of us.
And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today.
Thank you.

<title>Andreas Raptopoulos: No roads? There’s a drone for that</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A billion people in the world lack access to all-season roads. Could the structure of the internet provide a model for how to reach them? Andreas Raptopoulos of Matternet thinks so. He introduces a new type of transportation system that uses electric autonomous flying machines to deliver medicine, food, goods and supplies wherever they are needed.</description>
One billion people in the world today do not have access to all-season roads.
One billion people.
One seventh of the Earth's population are totally cut off for some part of the year.
We cannot get medicine to them reliably, they cannot get critical supplies, and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income.
In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, 85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season.
Investments are being made, but at the current level, it's estimated it's going to take them 50 years to catch up.
In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million miles of roads, very expensive to build, very expensive to maintain infrastructure, with a huge ecological footprint, and yet, very often, congested.
So we saw this and we thought, can there be a better way?
Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephones in the last 10 years?
Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground.
Could we do the same for transportation?
Imagine this scenario.
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali, and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.
What would you do today?
Well, you would place a request via mobile phone, and someone would get the request immediately.
That's the part that works.
The medication may take days to arrive, though, because of bad roads.
That's the part that's broken.
We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this.
This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms, over a short distance, about 10 kilometers, but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.
It's a network for a transportation of matter.
We call it Matternet.
We use three key technologies.
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.
The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther, or pick up or deliver loads.
And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network.
Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail.
First of all, the UAVs.
Eventually, we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges.
Today, we're using small quads.
These are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.
Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world, or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country.
These fly autonomously.
This is the key to the technology.
So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations.
Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism, so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations, they dock, swap a battery automatically, and go out again.
The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground.
They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission, which is the landing.
They are at known locations on the ground, so the paths between them are also known, which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network.
Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles, eventually they're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network.
The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network.
It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions, avoid other risk factors, and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network.
I want to show you what one of those flights looks like.
Here we are flying in Haiti last summer, where we've done our first field trials.
We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.
People there love this.
And I want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close.
So this is a $3,000 vehicle.
Costs are coming down very rapidly.
We use this in all sorts of weather conditions, very hot and very cold climates, very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.
Imagine if your life depended on this package, somewhere in Africa or in New York City, after Sandy.
The next big question is, what's the cost?
Well, it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle is just 24 cents.
And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today, and we're just at the beginning of this.
When we saw this, we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world.
So we said, okay, how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world?
And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.
The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed?
And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers?
That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan.
Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars.
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments.
We think this can be -- this is the power of a new paradigm.
So here we are: a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet.
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint.
If it is a new paradigm, though, there must be other uses for it.
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.
So let's look at the other end of the spectrum: our cities and megacities.
Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.
Half a billion of us live in megacities.
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.
China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years.
These are places that do have road infrastructure, but it's very inefficient.
Congestion is a huge problem.
So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet, initially for lightweight, urgent stuff, and over time, we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.
It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint, operating in the background 24/7, just like the Internet.
So when we started this a couple of years ago now, we've had a lot of people come up to us who said, "This is a very interesting but crazy idea, and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon."
And of course, we're talking about drones, right, a technology that's not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very, very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries, especially those engaged in conflict.
So why are we doing this?
Well, we chose to do this one not because it's easy, but because it can have amazing impact.
Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information.
Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter.
In the developing world, we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines, reach them with better medication.
It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.
Over time, we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions, lifting millions of people out of poverty.
In the developed world and the emerging world, we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable.
So for those that still believe that this is science fiction, I firmly say to you that it is not.
We do need to engage, though, in social fiction to make it happen.
Thank you.

<title>Jacqueline Novogratz: A third way to think about aid</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust "charity" against those who mistrust reliance on the markets. Jacqueline Novogratz proposes a middle way she calls patient capital, with promising examples of entrepreneurial innovation driving social change.</description>
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen.
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid.
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
We call it patient capital.
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it.
They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
Both sides are right.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.
After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people.
They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons.
First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption.
Third, they are often creating markets.
Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation.
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day.
They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.
At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant.
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again.
And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in.
And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.
Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption.
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.
This idea of scale is critical.
Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people.
But that's obviously not enough.
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important.
Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
President Obama understands that.
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it.
And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.
When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.
People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing.
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country.
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
I would say that the converse is true.
That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope.
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.
On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
It was about 115 degrees.
And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.
And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life.
His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day.
Because he was building these crops.
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
And he said, "Of course I will.
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity.
Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity.
Because that is where dignity really starts.
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive.
Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail.
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us, and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
I can only talk from my own experience, but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I know it works.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations.
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
Thank you.

<title>Paul Moller: My dream of a flying car</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Paul Moller talks about the future of personal air travel -- the marriage of autos and flight that will give us true freedom to travel off-road. He shows two things he's working on: the Moller Skycar and a passenger-friendly hovering disc.</description>
Many of you could ask the question, you know, why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately, a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?
A number of years ago, Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available.
Now, 60 years later, I'm here to tell you why it's possible.
When I was about five years old, not very much -- about a year after Mr. Ford made his predictions, I was living in a rural part of Canada, on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.
Getting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age, through the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.
It was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through.
At the end of my first year in school, in the summer of that year, I discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home.
They'd worn themselves out, beating themselves against the window, and, well, they were easy to capture.
I took them outside and as I let them go, that split second, even though they were very tired, that second I let them go they hovered for a second, then zipped off into the distance.
I thought, what a great way to get to school.
For a kid at that age, this was like infinite speed, disappearing, and I was very inspired by that.
And so the next -- over the next six decades, believe it or not, I've built a number of aircraft, with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me, what the hummingbird does, and give you that flexibility.
I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor, after the Latin word "volant," meaning, to fly in a light, nimble manner.
Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.
The FAA, the controlling body above all, calls it a "powered lift aircraft."
And they've actually issued a pilot's license -- a powerlift pilot's license -- for this type of aircraft.
It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft.
So for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself.
The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar."
This is a little bit earlier version of it, that's why it's given the X designation, but it's a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically, like a helicopter -- therefore it doesn't need an airfield.
On the ground, it's powered electrically.
It's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels, which is a great asset because it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways in most states, and actually in all cities.
So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile, forget it -- you're never going to fly it.
One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does, and gets around in much the same way, and it's true, but a helicopter is a very complex device.
It's expensive -- so expensive that very few people could own or use it.
It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity, as a series of parts -- a large number of parts -- flying in formation.
Another difference, and I have to describe this, because it's very personal, another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor -- in my case the Skycar volantor -- is the experience that I've had in flying both of those.
In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation -- you feel like you're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane.
When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you, there's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation -- you really feel like you're being lifted up by a magic carpet, without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.
And it's been a great motivator.
I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally, and only when I can persuade my stockholders to let me do so, but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time.
What we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50-plus mile trips.
Very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.
If we can get rid of that, then the highways will now be useful to you, as contrasted by what's happening in many parts of the world today.
On this next slide, is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure, because whether I give you a perfect Skycar, the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in.
I'm sure any of you have asked the question, yeah, are there great things up there -- what am I going to do, get up there?
It's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?
This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot, you're going to be a passenger.
And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward.
I can tell you, technically we can build Skycars -- my God, we went to the moon!
The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.
But we have to have these priority changes, we have to have infrastructure to go with this.
Historically you see that we got around 200 years ago by canals, and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.
As that disappeared we came in with highways.
But if you look at that top corner -- the highway system -- you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built, and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways in the next 10 years.
However, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years, we're going to see 30 percent more traffic.
And where is that going to lead you to?
So the issue then, I've often asked, is when is it going to happen?
When are we going to be able to have these vehicles?
And of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view.
After all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow.
So, I'm not going to quote myself on this.
I'd prefer to quote someone else, who testified with me before Congress, and in his position as head of NASA put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft.
Now I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today, you're only averaging about 30 miles per hour -- on average, according to the DOT -- the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour, up to 25,000 feet.
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned.
Unbeknownst to many of you, the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here has been under construction for 10 years.
It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile, but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S., there's a Russian GPS, and there's a new GPS system going to Europe, called Galileo.
With those three systems, you have what is always necessary -- a level of redundancy that says, if one system fails, you'll still have a way to make sure that you're being controlled.
Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing, it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you.
How would a trip in a Skycar work?
Well, you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy.
I mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.
But it's still fairly quiet.
You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport, which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.
This is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft, and you're not going to spend that much time on the road.
After all, if you can fly like that, why are you going to drive around on a highway?
Go to a local vertiport, plug in your destination, delivered almost like a passenger.
You can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way.
This is the world -- there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that -- and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there, flying around and experiencing that.
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.
But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.
Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.
We flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965, when I really got it started.
I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System, and I got a lot of excitement around this, and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.
And then through the various years we invented various vehicles.
Actually the critical point was in 1989, when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle -- how completely stable it was in all circumstances, which is of course very critical.
Still not a practical vehicle during all of this, but moving in the right direction, we believe.
Finally, in the early part of -- or actually the middle of 2002, we flew the 400 -- M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.
In this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.
And we had very small power plants in it at this time.
We are now installing larger powerplants, which will make it possible for me to get back on board.
A vertical-takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.
There's an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s, when every aeronautical company was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft.
A vertical-takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system -- that's essential.
At least for the hover, and the low-speed flight.
If that single-stability system, that brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails, that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.
And the adage that I'm referring to, that applied at that time, was that nothing comes down faster than a VTOL aircraft upside down.
That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots.
In fact, the aircraft companies gave up on vertical-takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years.
And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter -- and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet.
A vertical-takeoff aircraft, like the hummingbird, has a very high metabolism, which means it requires a lot of energy.
Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package.
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine.
A very unique engine -- it's round, it's small, it's vibration-free.
It fits exactly where we need to fit it, right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system -- very critical. In fact that engine -- for those who are into the automobile -- know that it recently is applied to the RX8 -- the Mazda.
And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.
Wonderful engine.
In that application, it generates one horsepower per pound, which is twice as good as your car engine today, but only half of what we need.
My company has spent 35 years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine, which was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical.
We actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot.
We have eight engines in this vehicle.
We have four computers. We have two parachutes.
Redundancy is the critical issue here.
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.
And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine, and continued to hover.
The computers back up each other. There's a voting system -- if one computer is not agreeing with the other three, it's kicked out of the system.
And then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy.
If one of those fails, you still have a second chance.
If you stick around, then good luck.
There won't be a third chance.
The parachutes are there -- hopefully, more for psychological than real reasons, but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that.
I'd like to show you an animation in this next one, which is one element of the Skycar's use, but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.
You could think of it personally in your own terms, of how you might use it.
Video: Skycar dispatched, launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.
Paul Moller: I believe that personal transportation in something like the Skycar, probably in another volantor form as well, will be a significant part of our lives, as Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.
And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.
If you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes, you're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment, buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain, buy a Skycar, which I think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell.
Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge.
Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what I'm doing -- both financially and in technical help.
And that has -- you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing, and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.
I characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism, as it's described, which really talks about what I've experienced, and I'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies.
There's an interesting poll that came out recently under NAS -- I think it's MSNBC -- in which they asked the question, "Are you in the market for a volantor?"
Twenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible."
Forty-seven percent -- yes, as soon as they could -- price could come down.
Twenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe."
Only seven percent said that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.
I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like, to some extent, it is becoming self-evident.
That we need an alternative to the automobile, at least for those 50-mile trips and more, so that the highways become usable in today's world.
Thank you.

<title>Rives: Reinventing the encyclopedia game</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Prompted by the Encyclopaedia Britannica ending its print publication, performance poet Rives resurrects a game from his childhood. Speaking at the TEDxSummit in Doha, Rives takes us on a charming tour through random bits of human knowledge: from Chimborazo, the farthest point from the center of the Earth, to Ham the Astrochimp, the first chimpanzee in outer space.</description>
So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after 244 years, which made me nostalgic, because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when I was a kid, maybe 12 years old.
And I wondered if I could update that game, not just for modern methods, but for the modern me.
So I tried.
I went to an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."
You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple.
You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know, and preferably something your dad doesn't even know.
And in this case, I quickly found this: The furthest point from the center of the Earth is not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought, it's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.
The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun, so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle, like some Earthlings.
And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes, it's one degree away from the equator, it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.
And it is really fun to say.
So I immediately decided, this is going to be the name of the game, or my new exclamation.
You can use it at TED.
Chimborazo, right?
It's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby.
I didn't know that; that's pretty cool.
Chimborazo!
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.
You just have to find another term and look that up.
Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically, maybe getting sidetracked, that was fun.
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.
I can go literally anywhere in the world, I think since I was already in Ecuador, I just decided to click on the word "tropical."
That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the Earth.
Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south, that much I knew, but I was surprised to learn this little fact: Those are not cartographers' lines, like latitude or the borders between nations, they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt, and they change.
They move; they go up, they go down.
In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about 15 meters per year, and nobody told me that.
I didn't know it.
Chimborazo!
So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.
Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest."
Famous for its diversity, human diversity.
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.
They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.
It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera, which turn out to be beetles.
Now I clicked on this on purpose, but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake, it does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles," for the car see "Volkswagon Beetle," but I am here for beetle beetles.
This is the most successful order on the planet by far.
Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet, including plants, are beetles.
That means the next time you are in the grocery store, take a look at the four people ahead of you in line.
Statistically, one of you is a beetle.
And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.
There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.
There are predator beetles, that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us.
There are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.
This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri, who renews the ball of the sun every morning, which is how that dung-rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.
Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.
Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.
Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.
Like my next link: The chemical language of pheromones.
Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.
Yeah.
And the link to aphrodisiac.
Now that's something that increases sexual desire, possibly chocolate.
There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac.
But as the article mentions, because of enzyme breakdown, it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.
So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.
The link I clicked on here, "sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean.
But not when they're together like that.
I do like sympathy. I do like magic.
So when I click on "sympathetic magic," I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.
This is the boy in me getting lucky again.
Sympathetic magic is imitation.
If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.
That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.
The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.
I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.
We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.
Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands, usually the left hand.
We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia, so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube, I can easily picture how he did it.
And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand," go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia I've found in a long time. It's simply this: The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.
Now that's embarrassing, because up until now, every time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand," I've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that, I just don't know it's freaking name, right?"
And the link I clicked on here, well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.
I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.
Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller."
He doesn't.
He lives in rainforests and savannas.
It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us, evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us, and in some cases, he gets places before us.
Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.
I click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.
He's born in Cameroon, which is smack in the middle of my tropics map, and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.
In between those two landmarks in Ham's life, he flew into space.
He experienced weightlessness and re-entry months before the first human being to do it, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page, I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature, huge in heroism.
Top estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters, that is less than five and a half feet tall max, possibly because he was malnourished as a child.
Germans occupied Russia.
A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household, and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.
Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space, the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.
And he didn't just leave it, he circled it once.
Fifty years later, as a tribute, the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight, synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit, at the exact same time of day, and filmed it, so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride, possibly a lonely one, the first person to ever see such a thing.
And then when you've had your fill of that, you can click on one more link.
You can come back to Earth.
You return to where you started.
You can finish your game.
You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.
And for me, I quickly landed on this one: The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid, which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.
This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.
I found it myself.
It's got some math that I can do.
I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.
What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball, if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls, fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea, you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball, it would be as smooth as a billiard ball, presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.
That's pretty cool.
I didn't know that.
Chimborazo!
Thank you.

<title>Lemn Sissay: A child of the state</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Literature has long been fascinated with fostered, adopted and orphaned children, from Moses to Cinderella to Oliver Twist to Harry Potter. So why do many parentless children feel compelled to hide their pasts? Poet and playwright Lemn Sissay tells his own moving story. </description>
Having spent 18 years as a child of the state in children's homes and foster care, you could say that I'm an expert on the subject, and in being an expert, I want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth.
If you're in care, legally the government is your parent, loco parentis.
Margaret Thatcher was my mother.
Let's not talk about breastfeeding.
Harry Potter was a foster child.
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted; Superman was a foster child; Cinderella was a foster child; Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, was fostered and institutionalized; Batman was orphaned; Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights" was fostered; Jane Eyre, adopted; Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;" Matilda; Moses -- Moses!
Moses! -- the boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;" Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;" Luke Skywalker -- Luke Skywalker! -- Oliver Twist; Cassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying; Celie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."
All of these great fictional characters, all of them who were hurt by their condition, all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films, all of them were fostered, adopted or orphaned.
It seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be.
That is, they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.
How have we not made the connection?
And why have we not made the connection, between — How has that happened? — between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child in our midst? It's not our pity that they need.
It's our respect.
I know famous musicians, I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned, and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background, as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground, as if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside. Children in care, who've had a life in care, deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood.
It is that simple.
My own mother — and I should say this here — she same to this country in the late '60s, and she was, you know, she found herself pregnant, as women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?
They found themselves pregnant.
And she sort of, she had no idea of the context in which she'd landed.
In the 1960s -- I should give you some context -- in the 1960s, if you were pregnant and you were single, you were seen as a threat to the community.
You were separated from your family by the state.
You were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes.
You were appointed a social worker.
The adoptive parents were lined up.
It was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim, to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.
So the adoption papers were signed.
The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.
The adoption papers were signed, the child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she'd been on a little break.
A little break.
A little break.
The first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman, "a little break."
The adoption process took, like, a matter of months, so it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal, an industrious, utilitarian solution: the government, the farmer, the adopting parents, the consumer, the mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.
It's kind of easy to patronize the past, to forego our responsibilities in the present.
What happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by God and by the state for the big society, fast-tracking adoption.
So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant, and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the Emperor Haile Selassie, and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech, the "Rivers of Blood" speech.
She lands months before the Beatles release "The White Album," months before Martin Luther King was killed.
It was a summer of love if you were white.
If you were black, it was a summer of hate.
So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.
It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses -- It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies. But the social worker, he had a different agenda.
He found the foster parents, and he said to them, "Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.
His name is Norman."
Norman!
Norman!
So they took me. I was a message, they said.
I was a sign from God, they said.
I was Norman Mark Greenwood.
Now, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman, this birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman too selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years kneeling and praying.
I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.
"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"
But I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."
And then I was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.
And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.
Who knew?
So anyway, two years sort of passed, and they had a child of their own, and then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own, and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident, which I thought was an unusual name.
And I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence, so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.
I was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.
Now, in their religiosity, in their naivete, my mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever, as they said they were, my mom and dad conceived that I had the Devil inside of me.
And what -- I should say this here, because this is how they engineered my leaving.
They sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me, "You don't love us, do you?" At 11 years old.
They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.
My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer.
So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them, which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.
"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine through me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.
The theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable, and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.
"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness."
"Because you don't love us, Norman, clearly you've chosen your path."
Twenty-four hours later, my social worker, this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months, he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.
I didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father, my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents, nobody.
On the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself, "What's happened to me?"
It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away.
When I got to the — For the next four, five years, I was held in four different children's homes.
On the third children's home, at 15, I started to rebel, and what I did was, I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models, and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it, and I poured them, red, yellow and green, the colors of Africa, down the tiles.
You couldn't see it from the street, because the home was surrounded by beech trees.
For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center. It was a virtual prison for young people.
By the way, years later, my social worker said that I should never have been put in there.
I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.
But because I had no family to inquire about me, they could do anything to me.
I'm 17 years old, and they had a padded cell.
They would march me down corridors in last-size order.
They -- I was put in a dormitory with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.
All of the staff were ex-police -- interesting -- and ex-probation officers.
The man who ran it was an ex-army officer.
Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know who would feed me grapes, once every three months, I was strip-searched.
That home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder.
And this was the preparation that I was being given after 17 years as a child of the state.
I have to tell this story.
I have to tell it, because there was no one to put two and two together.
I slowly became aware that I knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year.
See, that's what family does.
It gives you reference points.
I'm not defining a good family from a bad family.
I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is, a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle, a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone, and therefore it matters to you. Understand, I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself, and I wasn't touched either, physically touched.
I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that when I left the children's home I had two things that I wanted to do. One was to find my family, and the other was to write poetry.
In creativity I saw light.
In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life, the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality, the place where anger was an expression in the search for love, a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth.
I've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them, and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.
But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child.
I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.
Thanks very much. It's been an honor.

<title>Michael Merzenich: Growing evidence of brain plasticity</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Neuroscientist Michael Merzenich looks at one of the secrets of the brain's incredible power: its ability to actively re-wire itself. He's researching ways to harness the brain's plasticity to enhance our skills and recover lost function.</description>
This machine, which we all have residing in our skulls, reminds me of an aphorism, of a comment of Woody Allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.
And it's this machine.
And it's constructed for change. It's all about change.
It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today, things today that we couldn't do yesterday.
And of course it's born stupid.
The last time you were in the presence of a baby -- this happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.
Isn't she fabulous?
But nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb -- nonetheless she had very limited abilities, as does every infant at the time of normal, natural full-term birth.
If we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.
There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.
In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant.
Infants don't respond to much.
There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.
And they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way control their movements.
It would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it, usually to the mouth.
And it will be some months beforeward, and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles, to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling, standing, walking, before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world.
And yet, when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance.
By this age the brain can actually store.
It has stored, recorded, can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands, tens of thousands of objects, actions, and their relationships in the world.
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of ways.
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.
This brain is very much a thinking machine.
And by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain, it has a person on board.
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.
And by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement.
Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously, in a complex sequence, in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game, like soccer.
Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.
And where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil, about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.
You could go out into the community in Monterey, and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.
And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.
That's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments.
That environment extends into our contemporary culture, the thing our brain is challenged with.
Because what we've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories.
And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind, in the way that, in fact, no two of us are quite alike.
Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity, the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.
In an adult brain of course we've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory, and that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures.
Now we study this, as the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are, by engaging the brains of animals like rats, or monkeys, or of this particularly curious creature -- one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth -- to engage them in learning new skills and abilities.
And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired.
In fact we do this in individuals of any age, in these different species -- that is to say from infancies, infancy up to adulthood and old age.
So we might engage a rat, for example, to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub-skills, or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read.
Or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance.
From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain.
The first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period."
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery.
This is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.
All it takes for example in the sound domain, is exposure to sound.
And the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared.
So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound, a repertoire of sound that I make up, that I make, just by exposure, artificially important to the animal and its young brain.
And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way.
The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal: I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable, like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child.
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized -- specialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.
It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation, in multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms.
Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound.
I can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan, in the presence of continuous noise.
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound.
And I frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.
Such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies.
And they account for, for example the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor in every normally developing baby.
And so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited, as a consequence, in their language abilities at an older age.
Now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.
I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.
The input doesn't really have to be meaningful.
I don't have to be in a behavioral context.
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially, so that it can act selectively, so that the creature that wears it, that carries it, can begin to operate on it in a selective way.
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life, the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.
And in this epoch, which extends from late in the first year of life to death; it's actually doing this under behavioral control.
And that's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain.
And it's focusing on skill after skill, or ability after ability, under specific attentional control.
It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.
This is actually very powerful.
This lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change, is powerfully expressed.
It is the basis of our real differentiation, one individual from another.
You can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill, and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.
So here is a very simple experiment.
It was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence in Marseilles.
It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.
The monkey actually mastered the task in about 700 practice tries.
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries.
Those tries were elaborate.
Each attempt was substantially different from the other.
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.
And 700 or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails.
He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.
At this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way: very beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial.
We can look down in the brain of the monkey.
And we see that it's distorted.
We can track these changes, and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time.
And here we see the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.
Now this is a map, down in the surface of the brain, in which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses, location by location, in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.
We see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain.
We've actually distorted the map by the exercise.
And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.
If we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey, we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged.
In other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body.
Monkey has like you have.
And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.
The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected, maybe, by you -- part of acquiring the skill or ability.
Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task.
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability.
So for example we can look to the cortical area that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.
We look in cortical areas that control specific movements, and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior, and so forth.
They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this.
And that represents in your brain, really massive change.
It represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.
It represents changes of hundreds of millions, possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain.
This is constructed by physical change.
And the level of construction that occurs is massive.
Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.
Or acquiring their native language abilities.
The changes are massive.
What it's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain.
Because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context.
It's what you pay attention to.
It's what's rewarding to you.
It's what the brain regards, itself, as positive and important to you.
It's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization.
And that underlies your specialization.
That is why you, in your many skills and abilities, are a unique specialist: a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual 100 years ago; enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.
Now, one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time, in context.
And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.
The brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context.
Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that's occurred in your brain is you.
Billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver, or yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker, yourself as the mover.
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver, and that result in the embodiment of you.
You are constructed, your self is constructed from these billions of events.
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.
And it's created in the brain via physical change.
This is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories, and vastly different experiences, that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self, of personhood.
Now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops, and elaborates their skills and abilities, but also try to understand the origins of impairment, and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.
I'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity-based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and, thereafter, as a reader.
And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science, first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.
And then, by using it in a targeted approach we're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age.
So the first example I'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments.
We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments, and that are going to struggle to learn to read, is that their language processor is created in a defective form.
And the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby's brain's life the machine process is noisy.
It's that simple.
It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that.
There are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier.
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears.
If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation.
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively; we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities; and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.
Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures.
That's disappeared. That no longer applies.
That inherited weakness, that inherited condition has evaporated.
We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?
Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon, about 35 years ago, that if you simply fix the problem early enough, when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately, in this initial set up time in the critical period, none of that happens.
What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?
You're basically opening up the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears, which have had them reliably full.
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.
It's degraded.
The child's native language is such a case is not English.
It's not Japanese.
It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.
It's crap.
And the brain specializes for it.
It creates a representation of language crap.
And then the child is stuck with it.
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.
It can also happen in the brain.
The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.
And the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded.
It's not English. It's noisy English.
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words -- not normal -- a different strategy, by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.
They are about an order of magnitude longer, about 11 times longer in duration on average, than in a normal child.
Space constants are about three times greater.
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain.
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language, they are receiving it and representing it, and in information it's representing crap.
And they are going to have poor reading skills.
Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form.
If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense.
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.
Then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation, in their operations in language, and their operations in reading -- we document that abnormal neurology.
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it.
Changing it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.
And we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.
Actually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.
And actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial.
So here we're looking at the normal distribution.
What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.
This is from about 3,000 children.
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right.
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.
This is like an IQ test for language.
The impact in the distribution, if you trained every child in the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution.
This is a substantially large impact.
Think of a classroom of children in the language arts.
Think of the children on the slow side of the class.
We have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side.
In addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production.
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training -- that is to say reading.
And to a large extent it fixes the brain.
You can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford, and MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.
And children operating in various language behaviors, or in various reading behaviors, you see for the most extent, for most children, their neuronal responses, complexly abnormal before you start, are normalized by the training.
Now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging.
Where again the machinery is deteriorating now from competent machinery, it's going south.
Noise is increasing in the brain.
And learning modulation and control is deteriorating.
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning, it's going back into chaos in the end.
This results in declines in memory in cognition, and in postural ability and agility.
It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual -- this is a small population of such individuals -- train equally intensively for about 30 hours.
These are 80- to 90-year-olds.
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory, of their ability to remember things after a delay, of their ability to control their attention, their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.
The overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations.
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution, and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities, the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution.
It means that most people who are at risk for senility, more or less immediately, are now in a protected position.
My issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers, because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids.
My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.
I'm specifically interested in things like autism, and cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.
And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism, and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.
Your issues as it relates to this science, is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.
And of course, a well-ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.
But also in your future is brain aerobics.
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future, just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.
Now that you know, now that science is telling us that you are in charge, that it's under your control, that your happiness, your well-being, your abilities, your capacities, are capable of continuous modification, continuous improvement, and you're the responsible agent and party.
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice.
It will be a long time before they really understand it.
Now that's another issue and not my fault.
Okay. Thank you.

<title>Fiorenzo Omenetto: Silk, the ancient material of the future</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Fiorenzo Omenetto shares 20+ astonishing new uses for silk, one of nature's most elegant materials -- in transmitting light, improving sustainability, adding strength and making medical leaps and bounds. On stage, he shows a few intriguing items made of the versatile stuff.</description>
Thank you.
I'm thrilled to be here.
I'm going to talk about a new, old material that still continues to amaze us, and that might impact the way we think about material science, high technology -- and maybe, along the way, also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.
So that's kind of a bold statement.
I'll tell you a little bit more.
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.
It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature -- and is biodegradable with a clock, so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years.
It's edible; it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response.
It actually gets reintegrated in the body.
And it's technological, so it can do things like microelectronics, and maybe photonics do.
And the material looks something like this.
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.
The components of this material are just water and protein.
So this material is silk.
So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk.
So the question is, how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia?
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.
And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.
The silk worm does a remarkable thing: it uses these two ingredients, protein and water, that are in its gland, to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar.
And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about, and that we're familiar with, for the textile industry, the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things.
We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar.
So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material.
And this is an insight that came, about two decades ago, from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with, David Kaplan.
And so we get this starting material.
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block.
And then we use this to do a variety of things -- like, for example, this film.
And we take advantage of something that is very simple.
The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.
They find their way to self-assemble.
So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it, and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.
And then you detach the protein and you get this film, as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates.
But I mentioned that the film is also technological.
And so what does that mean?
It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology, like microelectronics and nanoscale technology.
And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface, which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.
So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD.
And we can store information that's film with water and protein.
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk, which is right here, and the message is over there.
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.
And this requires a stable hand, so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people.
So let me see.
So as you see the film go in transparently through there, and then ...
And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that.
So once you have these attributes of this material, then you can do a lot of things.
It's actually not limited to films.
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.
And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays, like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.
Or you can do beautiful things that, if the camera can capture, you can make.
You can add a third dimensionality to the film.
And if the angle is right, you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk.
But you can do other things.
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light, and so we've made optical fibers.
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.
And you can think of different formats.
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle, we do microneedle arrays.
What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that's made of silk -- just to give you a sense of size.
You can do bigger things.
You can do gears and nuts and bolts -- that you can buy at Whole Foods.
And the gears work in water as well.
So you think of alternative mechanical parts.
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins, for example, or maybe an entire bone.
And so you have here a little example of a small skull -- what we call mini Yorick.
But you can do things like cups, for example, and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap.
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.
So there's versatility, as you see, in the material formats, that you can do with silk.
But there are still some unique traits.
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats, in principle, can be implanted and disappear.
And what you see there in that tissue section, in fact, is you see that reflector tape.
So, much like you're seen at night by a car, then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue, you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.
And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing, but reintegration in the environment is important.
So you have a clock, you have protein, and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.
It's edible, so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food.
It doesn't taste good, so I'm going to need some help with that.
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.
Silk, during its self-assembly process, acts like a cocoon for biological matter.
And so if you change the recipe, and you add things when you pour -- so you add things to your liquid silk solution -- where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines, the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants.
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive.
So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same, while your bone is healing, for example.
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.
So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it.
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C, so 140 degrees Fahrenheit, for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.
And so that could be --- that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels.
And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it].
And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.
And so what you see there is the difference.
In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade, and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it.
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen.
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.
We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do, whether you want to replace a vein or a bone, or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics, perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt, maybe carry your drugs in your pocket, deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert, the answer may be in a thread of silk.
Thank you.

<title>Jonathan Haidt: How common threats can make common ground</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: If an asteroid were headed for Earth, we'd all band together and figure out how to stop it, just like in the movies, right? And yet, when faced with major, data-supported, end-of-the-world problems in real life, too often we retreat into partisan shouting and stalemate. Jonathan Haidt shows us a few of the very real asteroids headed our way -- some pet causes of the left wing, some of the right -- and suggests how both wings could work together productively to benefit humanity as a whole.</description>
So if you've been following the news, you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States, all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.
Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.
That actually wouldn't be such a problem, because if we were really all going to die, we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took, and we'd find a way to deflect them.
I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way, but they're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.
Last March, I went to the TED conference, and I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist who first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s, and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true.
This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises, and if we keep on going the way we're going, we get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise by the end of this century.
Hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.
This is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.
Low-lying cities all around the world will disappear within the lifetime of children born today.
Hansen closed his talk by saying, "Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.
That is the equivalent of what we face now.
Yet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid, even though the longer we wait, the more difficult and expensive it becomes."
Of course, the left wants to take action, but the right denies that there's any problem.
All right, so I go back from TED, and then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party in Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin, and to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin in National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State."
Levin writes that all over the world, nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable, dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era.
All right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid, but look at these graphs that Levin showed.
This graph shows the national debt as a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see, if you go all the way back to the founding, we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.
Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.
Borrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, get down to near zero, and bang! -- World War I.
Once again, the same process repeats.
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II.
We rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP, really unsustainable, really dangerous.
But we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?
Why has it been rising since the '70s?
It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded, but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending, especially Medicare.
We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II, and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet, and when they do, this is what will happen.
This is data from the Congressional Budget Office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended.
All right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes, or in terms of the data they present, but in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.
Let me translate for you.
"We are doomed unless we start acting now.
What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?
Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."
We can deflect both of these asteroids.
These problems are both technically solvable.
Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times, the mere fact that one side says, "Look, there's an asteroid," means that the other side's going to say, "Huh? What?
No, I'm not even going to look up. No."
To understand why this is happening to us, and what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.
So I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality, and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds.
It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.
Think of it like this.
Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.
There are only a few species that can do it.
That's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.
And when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.
They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen, so they're all in the same boat.
They rise or fall, they live or die, as one.
There's only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship, and that, of course, is us.
This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon, and this is Tenochtitlan.
Now how did we do this? How did we go from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?
It's miraculous, and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values.
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.
This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.
It's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together, they unite, they can trust each other, they become one.
It's as though you're moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current.
When people circle together, they generate a current.
We love to circle around things.
We circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.
We can fight as a team, as a unit.
But even as morality binds people together into a unit, into a team, the circling blinds them.
It causes them to distort reality.
We begin separating everything into good versus evil.
Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.
But it is a gross distortion of reality.
You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis, so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is, you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.
And what you can see is that, in the decades after the Civil War, Congress was extraordinarily polarized, as you would expect, about as high as can be.
But then, after World War I, things dropped, and we get this historically low level of polarization.
This was a golden age of bipartisanship, at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together and solve grand national problems.
But in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.
Polarization rises.
It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress.
They could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees, but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up, the force field increased, Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart.
It became much harder for them to socialize, much harder for them to cooperate.
Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.
Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates, Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?
Do you know why they do this?
It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for.
The polarization is strongest among our political elites.
Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.
But for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.
Well, in the last 12 years it's become much more apparent that it is.
So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.
And what they do on that survey is they ask what's called a feeling thermometer rating.
So, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know, Native Americans, or the military, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.
The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel about Democrats, and they like them.
You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.
Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.
But when you look at cross-party ratings, you find, well, that it's lower, but actually, when I first saw this data, I was surprised.
That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations, they were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.
It drifts downwards very slightly, but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.
It plummets. Something is going on here.
The moral electromagnet is turning back on, and nowadays, just very recently, Democrats really dislike Republicans.
Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.
It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart, pulling left and right into their own territories like the Bloods and the Crips.
Now, there are many reasons why this is happening to us, and many of them we cannot reverse.
We will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in World War II against a common enemy.
We will never again have just three television networks, all of which are relatively centrist.
And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Republicans making it easy, making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.
So for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War were an historically anomalous time.
We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.
But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better, because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.
These changes are detailed in many books.
These are two that I strongly recommend, and they list a whole bunch of reforms.
I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.
So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional, hyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is, do what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place, and when you have closed party primaries, and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting, you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.
So open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.
But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.
From my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders, most of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working, intelligent people who really want to solve problems, but once they get there, they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship and that punishes independent thinking.
You step out of line, you get punished.
So there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this.
For example, this "Citizens United" ruling is a disaster, because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head, and if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle, there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.
But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change the nature of social relationships in Congress.
The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted, friendly, very socially skillful people, and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships, make deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter, you've got to use your personal skills, and that's the way politics has always worked.
But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.
Nowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning, they do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.
They don't move their families to the District.
They don't meet each other's spouses or children.
There's no more relationship there.
And trying to run Congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil.
Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization?
A simple change to the legislative calendar, such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home, that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.
So there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?
There are a number of groups that are working on this.
No Labels and Common Cause, I think, have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.
But I'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.
Nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy, unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology, in which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.
Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.
But what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this, where there's just so much stuff coming in, it's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody, we've got to just work together, just start shooting."
Because actually, we do face this situation.
This is where we are as a country.
So here's another asteroid.
We've all seen versions of this graph, right, which shows the changes in wealth since 1979, and as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.
Rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy.
Especially, it destroys our ability to trust each other, to feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.
Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.
Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.
We're not all in the same boat, and that means nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.
The left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now, and the right says, "Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."
Now, why is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?
Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization, is actually this fourth asteroid, rising non-marital births.
This graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births since the 1960s.
Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.
Whites are headed that way too.
Within a decade or two, most American children will be born into homes with no father.
This means that there's much less money coming into the house.
But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.
As I know from working with street children in Brazil, Mom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.
Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s, and the left has been saying, "It's not a problem. It's not a problem."
The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children.
Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.
I'm actually more critical of the men who won't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children.
But even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem, and one side has been more concerned about it than the other.
The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid with a front-page story last July showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.
We are becoming a nation of just two classes.
When Americans go to college and marry each other, they have very low divorce rates.
They earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids, some of them become tiger mothers, the kids rise to their full potential, and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph.
And then there's everybody else: the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage, who don't have as much invested in them, who don't grow up in a stable environment, and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.
So once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.
As before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this, we've got to do something, and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?
But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders, we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together.
Because if you really care about income inequality, you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage.
But then you're going to run smack into the problem that women don't generally want to marry someone who doesn't have a job.
So if you really care about strengthening families, you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality, who are working on raising the minimum wage, who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.
So to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.
How many of you can see all four?
Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems.
Please raise your hands.
Okay, almost all of you.
Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members of the Asteroids Club, which is a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point.
In the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.
Common ground is often very hard to find.
No, we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground.
Now, am I being naive? Is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords, and left and right could actually work together?
I don't think so, because it happens, not all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.
This is something we can do.
Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility, and they've formed dozens of organizations, at the national level, such as this one, down to many local organizations, such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida, which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate that sort of working together human relationship that's necessary to solve Florida's problems.
Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS, and on so many humanitarian issues, liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies, and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems.
And most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice.
For example, the incarceration rate, the prison population in this country has quadrupled since 1980.
Now this is a social disaster, and liberals are very concerned about this.
The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system that's just sucking in more and more poor young men.
But are conservatives happy about this?
Well, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money.
And so, because the prison-industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls, groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives have come together to form a group called Right on Crime.
And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane.
So this is possible. We can do it.
Let us therefore go to battle stations, not to fight each other, but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids.
And let our first mission be to press Congress to reform itself, before it's too late for our nation.
Thank you.

<title>Lee Cronin: Print your own medicine</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Chemist Lee Cronin is working on a 3D printer that, instead of objects, is able to print molecules. An exciting potential long-term application: printing your own medicine using chemical inks.</description>
Organic chemists make molecules, very complicated molecules, by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering.
And as a chemist, one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is, could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?
In essence, could we "app" chemistry?
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?
we took a 3D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware.
And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time, we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.
Now what could this mean?
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way.
So how are we doing this in the lab?
Well it requires software, it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks.
And so the really cool bit is, the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer, and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device.
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.
So what could this mean?
Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.
And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment.
But to take baby steps to get there, first of all we want to look at drug design and production, or drug discovery and manufacturing.
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere.
You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.
We can print drugs at point of need.
We can download new diagnostics.
Say a new super bug has emerged.
You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat.
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.
But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells, with your genes and your environment, and you print your own personal medicine.
And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough, where do you think we're going to go?
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.
Beam me up, Scotty.

<title>Eli Pariser: Beware online "filter bubbles"</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As web companies strive to tailor their services to our personal tastes, there's a dangerous unintended consequence: We get trapped in a "filter bubble" and don't get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview. Eli Pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy.</description>
Mark Zuckerberg, a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed.
And the journalist was asking him, "Why is this so important?"
And Zuckerberg said, "A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa."
And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like.
So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine, the Internet meant something very different to me.
It meant a connection to the world.
It meant something that would connect us all together.
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society.
But there's this shift in how information is flowing online, and it's invisible.
And if we don't pay attention to it, it could be a real problem.
So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time -- my Facebook page.
I'm progressive, politically -- big surprise -- but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives.
I like hearing what they're thinking about; I like seeing what they link to; I like learning a thing or two.
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed.
And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on, and it was noticing that, actually, I was clicking more on my liberal friends' links than on my conservative friends' links.
And without consulting me about it, it had edited them out.
They disappeared.
So Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible, algorithmic editing of the Web.
Google's doing it too.
If I search for something, and you search for something, even right now at the very same time, we may get very different search results.
Even if you're logged out, one engineer told me, there are 57 signals that Google looks at -- everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located -- that it uses to personally tailor your query results.
Think about it for a second: there is no standard Google anymore.
And you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see.
You can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's.
But a couple of weeks ago, I asked a bunch of friends to Google "Egypt" and to send me screen shots of what they got.
So here's my friend Scott's screen shot.
And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot.
When you put them side-by-side, you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are.
But when you do read the links, it's really quite remarkable.
Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results.
Scott's results were full of them.
And this was the big story of the day at that time.
That's how different these results are becoming.
So it's not just Google and Facebook either.
This is something that's sweeping the Web.
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization.
Yahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet, is now personalized -- different people get different things.
Huffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways.
And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.
As Eric Schmidt said, "It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them."
So I do think this is a problem.
And I think, if you take all of these filters together, you take all these algorithms, you get what I call a filter bubble.
And your filter bubble is your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online.
And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are, and it depends on what you do.
But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in.
And more importantly, you don't actually see what gets edited out.
So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix.
And they were looking at the Netflix queues, and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed, which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses.
They enter the queue, they just zip right out.
So "Iron Man" zips right out, and "Waiting for Superman" can wait for a really long time.
What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves.
You know we all want to be someone who has watched "Rashomon," but right now we want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time.
So the best editing gives us a bit of both.
It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan.
It gives us some information vegetables; it gives us some information dessert.
And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters, these personalized filters, is that, because they're mainly looking at what you click on first, it can throw off that balance.
And instead of a balanced information diet, you can end up surrounded by information junk food.
What this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong.
In a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society, there were these gatekeepers, the editors, and they controlled the flows of information.
And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way, and it allowed all of us to connect together, and it was awesome.
But that's not actually what's happening right now.
What we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones.
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did.
So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us, if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see, then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance.
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important -- this is what TED does -- other points of view.
And the thing is, we've actually been here before as a society.
In 1915, it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities.
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important.
That, in fact, you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information, that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter, and then journalistic ethics developed.
It wasn't perfect, but it got us through the last century.
And so now, we're kind of back in 1915 on the Web.
And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing.
I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google -- Larry and Sergey -- people who have helped build the Web as it is, and I'm grateful for that.
But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life, a sense of civic responsibility.
We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters.
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't.
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being.
We need it to connect us all together.
We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives.
And it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one.
Thank you.

<title>Robert Thurman: Expanding your circle of compassion</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It’s hard to always show compassion -- even to the people we love, but Robert Thurman asks that we develop compassion for our enemies. He prescribes a seven-step meditation exercise to extend compassion beyond our inner circle.</description>
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement, just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.
He said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' -- a part limited in time and space.
He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology, wherein compassion -- "karuna," it is called -- is defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy, which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it.
This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others, and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free and, implicitly, more happy.
The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.
It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.
Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others, even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.
In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous, his own becomes less and less monumental.
And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.
And this immediately cheers him up, as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.
Thus, he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.
He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.
Now, I want to tell a story, which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition, of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.
And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.
And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.
And so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine.
They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment, but they are acting selfish and pathetic.
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now, but exists currently in a certain heaven" -- that's Maitreya -- "so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me, and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today."
So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.
And he left in disgust.
And as he was leaving, he saw a man -- a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.
And he had a lump of iron.
And he was rubbing it with a cloth.
And he became interested in that.
He said, "Well what are you doing?"
And the man said, "I'm making a needle."
And he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."
And the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.
So he said, "Okay, I get the point."
He went back to his cave. He meditated again.
Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.
This time, he comes down.
And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff, its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
So he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.
Another three years.
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping, making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.
And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision.
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas -- and he's looking just terrible.
And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic, and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.
And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.
Some of it is like gangrenous, and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.
He thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?
Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it."
So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean, but then his awareness focuses on the maggots.
And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.
And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.
"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?
That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya, and everything is all hopeless.
And now I'm going to kill the maggots?"
So, he had a brilliant idea.
And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh, and he placed it on ground.
He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.
He was just immediately caught with the situation.
So he thought, "I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh, then clean the dog's wounds, and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots."
So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.
Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.
So he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.
And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue" -- the dog is kind of used up -- "and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing."
So he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.
And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.
And then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.
He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body, an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.
And he says, "Oh." He bows.
But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.
So as he comes up from his first bow he says, "My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?
What is this?"
And Maitreya says, "I was with you. Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"
"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.
And he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.
And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."
"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit.
And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.
And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you."
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball -- took him on his shoulder.
And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice!
The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."
And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him -- it wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town -- because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man, like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder, shouting that the future Buddha had come.
So, naturally, they chased him out of town.
But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground, saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog, but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.
So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven, which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.
And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years, dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.
A famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."
And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one -- even animals too, but everyone is in human form.
The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.
And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.
And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.
And then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.
I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.
I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.
So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.
And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.
But they are nice to somebody. I could be them."
And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives, we've all been each other's relatives, actually.
Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view, in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I, have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.
And also, actually, I've been your mother.
I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life, the way the Buddhists reflect.
So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother.
You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.
So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.
A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.
So, in that sense, we're related.
So, they first create this foundation of equality.
So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love -- just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.
And we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them" to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.
And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.
And then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition."
And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.
We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama, and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.
And we see the mother in every being.
We see that look that the mother has on her face, looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal, where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.
Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.
And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.
The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings, in spiritual traditions.
And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.
People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom, when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.
I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.
He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.
And you think of him as nursing you.
And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem, but you think of him as a mom.
And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you, and you see how they could be familiar to you.
And you do that for a while, until you really feel that.
You can feel the familiarity of all beings.
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other."
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.
Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general, if you can remember the kindness of your own mother, if you can remember the kindness of your spouse, or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.
And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.
You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.
Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.
And then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude."
You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."
In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy, when they are satisfied.
And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.
Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being, but when they're happy they look beautiful.
And so you see beings in their potential happiness.
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.
We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says, "Love thine enemy."
He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."
But, actually, that's practical.
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.
If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?
How boring to run around chasing you.
They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy, because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.
But anyway, that's the "lovely love. " And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, "universal compassion."
And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.
And you look at them, and you see how they are.
And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.
You see that furrowed brow in people.
And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.
They're driven by this duty and this obligation.
"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something."
And they're rushing around all stressed out.
And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.
But actually they are cruel to themselves.
And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.
And they, then, never get any positive feedback.
And the more they succeed and the more power they have, the more unhappy they are.
And this is where you feel real compassion for them.
And you then feel you must act.
And the choice of the action, of course, hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him, he wanted to help.
But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.
And I'm sure he did that later. But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" -- is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way, and you have compassion for yourself also, and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.
Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways.
And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.
Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.
And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing, by dying, but they don't.
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.
Never mind. I won't get into that.
But the next step is called "universal responsibility."
And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion, what is called "universal responsibility."
In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere, he says that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us: we are responsible for that, and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it.
We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.
And then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy.
One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.
Compassion makes you happy.
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself, even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.
Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings: they can sense this new quality in yourself, and it helps them already, and gives them an example.
And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.
So, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it and develop it within yourself.
Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate," and sort of think you're stuck there.
You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion, the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others, and take universal responsibility for them.
And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile, but Karen Armstrong will smile.
Thank you very much.

<title>Alan Russell: The potential of regenerative medicine</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Alan Russell studies regenerative medicine -- a breakthrough way of thinking about disease and injury, using a process that can signal the body to rebuild itself.</description>
I'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope.
When we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in, there are words that we just don't want to hear.
There are words that we're truly afraid of.
Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart failure, lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases, for which there's relatively little that can be done.
And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease, why it's important, why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't, and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow, and what some of the hurdles are.
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
I want to start with this slide, because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand.
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale.
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
This is not regenerative medicine.
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and I'll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
So that at the end of the treatment, you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel.
And this is just the same.
If you look back in history, Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes, was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller, to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
And they published this book in 1937, where they actually began to think about, what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
We've come a long way since then.
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
But before doing that, what I'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you.
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty, and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older.
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
And you can basically see that the richer a country is, the older the people are within it.
Why is this important?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
If the average age of your population is 30, then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again, maybe a little bit of asthma.
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55, now the average person is looking at diabetes, early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease -- things that are inherently more difficult to treat, and much more expensive to treat.
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
This is from "The Untied States of America."
In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick, paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this?
This is age versus cost of health care.
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45, there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies, you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care, plotted over your lifetime.
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
And you can actually -- -- we won't get into that.
There are very few things, very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging.
I'd suggest there are four things, and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
All those things do is change who pays.
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
You can prevent.
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important, is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression, and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom.
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic, and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
But eventually it stops working, and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease, perhaps even before it was symptomatic?
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it, but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
This is a newt re-growing its limb.
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment.
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body, for tissues and for organs themselves.
So today's reality is that if we get sick, the message is we will treat your symptoms, and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
I would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate, but it's within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
There's a limb prosthetic up here, similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq.
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually face the regeneration of that limb.
It's a wild concept.
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
How can we do that?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
We need to learn to speak the body's language.
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy, will re-grow that limb.
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
It's a natural process, but it is lost as we age.
In a child, before the age of about six months, if they lose their fingertip in an accident, they'll re-grow their fingertip.
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
So to engage in that conversation with the body, we need to speak the body's language.
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body.
The first is cellular therapies.
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process, using cells to do most of the work.
Therefore, if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
Secondly, we can use materials.
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
I'm going to show you an example of each of these, and I'm going to start with materials.
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself.
And he asked a very important question.
He asked the question, if I take that material, which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine, and I place it somewhere else on a person's body, would it give a tissue-specific response, or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
The picture I'm about to show you However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet, check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
This is the reality of diabetes.
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers, we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment, which is amputation, if you can't heal it.
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
The treatment for this is amputation.
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes, and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer, that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
That material contained only natural signals.
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before.
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- I'll let you know when you can look again.
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident.
Just a few weeks after treatment -- in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel, and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times -- and the horse heals up.
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.
There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds.
Could you regenerate a limb?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question.
And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
After treatment that's what it looks like.
This is happening today.
This is clinically relevant today.
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
But could you go a little further?
Could you, say, instead of using material, can I take some cells along with the material, and remove a damaged piece of tissue, put a bio-degradable material on there?
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
He chills the dish, it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish.
It's the coolest stuff.
Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
But this one's kind of cool.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference.
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation, you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient.
And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
And if you look really carefully, it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back-flush.
You see the cells coming back out.
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices, to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
This was a randomized trial.
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass, for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
These are now two years out.
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early, and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively, with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
There go the cells.
We don't have time to go into all of those details, but basically, that works too.
You can take patients who are less sick, and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy.
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet, but I think very soon will be.
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh, along with a number of colleagues around the world.
They've decided that liposuction fluid, which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
It's a great source of stem cells.
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
Out comes the liposuction fluid, and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
All done in the lab.
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease.
Here's just one example before I close up.
This is equally tragic.
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army, who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
Many of those patients are very severely burned.
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn, it's that we don't know how to treat it.
Everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach.
We make something over here, and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound, and we try and get the two to take.
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR -- by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
The gun that you see there sprays cells.
That's going to spray cells over that area.
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment, deliver other things as well at the same time, and therefore we will seed that lawn, as opposed to try the sodding approach.
It's a completely different way of doing it.
So my 18 minutes is up.
So let me finish up with some good news, and maybe a little bit of bad news.
The good news is that this is happening today.
It's very powerful work.
Clearly the images kind of get that across.
It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen.
A number of governments, and a number of regions, have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
The Japanese government were perhaps the first, when they decided to invest first 3 billion, later another 2 billion in this field.
It's no coincidence.
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
They need this to work or their health system dies.
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
The European Union, same thing.
China, the same thing.
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.
Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
We've had a different approach.
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot, at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago, to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients.
And at the end of a very testy meeting, what the NIH director said was, "Your vision is larger than our appetite."
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision, but together we can change his appetite.
Thank you.

<title>Terry Moore: Why is 'x' the unknown?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Why is 'x' the symbol for an unknown? In this short and funny talk, Terry Moore gives the surprising answer.</description>
I have the answer to a question that we've all asked.
The question is, Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown?
Now I know we learned that in math class, but now it's everywhere in the culture -- The X prize, the X-Files, Project X, TEDx.
Where'd that come from?
About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic, which turns out to be a supremely logical language.
To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation, because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information.
That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks.
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra.
And al-jebr roughly translates to "the system for reconciling disparate parts."
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra.
One example among many.
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe -- which is to say Spain -- in the 11th and 12th centuries.
And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language.
But there were problems.
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don't make it through a European voice box without lots of practice.
Trust me on that one.
Also, those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages.
Here's one of the culprits.
This is the letter SHeen, and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh."
It's also the very first letter of the word shalan, which means "something" just like the the English word "something" -- some undefined, unknown thing.
Now in Arabic, we can make this definite by adding the definite article "al."
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing.
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics, such as this 10th century derivation of proofs.
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH, that "sh" sound.
So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound, from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai.
Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X.
And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years.
But now we have the answer to our question.
Why is it that X is the unknown?
X is the unknown because you can't say "sh" in Spanish.
And I thought that was worth sharing.

<title>Mike Biddle: We can recycle plastic</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Less than 10% of plastic trash is recycled -- compared to almost 90% of metals -- because of the massively complicated problem of finding and sorting the different kinds. Frustrated by this waste, Mike Biddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can, and does, recycle any kind of plastic.</description>
I'm a garbage man.
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man, because I absolutely hate waste.
I hope, within the next 10 minutes, to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life.
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.
Think back when you were just a kid.
How did look at the stuff in your life?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules: It's my stuff if I saw it first.
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
The more stuff that's mine, the better.
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry, it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults.
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff.
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent.
In fact, the United Nations estimates that there's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth, that number well more than doubles.
And of course, the more developed the country, the bigger these mountains.
Now when you see these mountains, most people think of garbage.
We see above-ground mines.
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams.
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff.
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted.
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day?
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world.
And the plastics, we get from oil, which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract.
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today.
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff, particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner.
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff, if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.
To put that in perspective -- and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals, because it's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler, probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.
Plastics are a whole other story: well less than 10 percent are recovered.
In fact, it's more like five percent.
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material, have very little value.
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel.
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material?
Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another.
They have very different densities.
They have different electrical and magnetic properties.
And they even have different colors.
So it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials.
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties.
And any plastic can be any color, as you probably well know.
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics.
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling.
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover, which is, again, mostly the plastics.
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here.
And they extract the metals by hand.
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution, this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution.
I call this environmental arbitrage.
And it's not fair, it's not safe and it's not sustainable.
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way, those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics.
This is just one example.
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.
They store the plastics on the roofs.
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these, and people try very hard to separate the plastics, by color, by shape, by feel, by any technique they can.
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic.
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way.
And by the way, please don't try this technique at home.
So what are we to do about this space-age material, at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke.
So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around, trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other, and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends, in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world, and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.
And we eventually broke the code.
This is the last frontier of recycling.
It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.
And we finally figured out how to do it.
And in the process, we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics.
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals.
You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways, to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint, sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
Well a good place to start is with waste.
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil, and it's plentiful, as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them, we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment.
We have enormous energy savings.
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way.
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life, our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings.
They get to close the loop with their products.
And they get to make more sustainable products.
In the short time period I have, I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.
They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials, but predominantly plastics.
We take out the things that aren't plastics, such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber, wood, glass, paper, you name it.
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.
And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets, we're using air classification.
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite: many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics.
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process, and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics, not only by type, but by grade.
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic: one type, one grade.
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
We push that material to extruders where we melt it, push it through small die holes, make spaghetti-like plastic strands.
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets.
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.
This is the same material that you would get from oil.
And today, we're producing it from your old stuff, and it's going right back into your new stuff.
So now, instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke, you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products, in your office, or back at work in your home.
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products.
So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life.
We took our clues from mother nature.
Mother nature wastes very little, reuses practically everything.
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form, until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time.
And finally, I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."
Thank you for your time.

<title>Lalitesh Katragadda: Making maps to fight disaster, build economies</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped. This slows the delivery of aid after a disaster -- and hides the economic potential of unused lands and unknown roads. In this short talk, Google's Lalitesh Katragadda demos Map Maker, a group map-making tool that people around the globe are using to map their world.</description>
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.
Millions of people were in severe need of help.
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces: not having detailed maps.
But help was coming.
At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
And it took them four days.
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally.
People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers, from schools to local businesses, and video stores to the corner store.
Maps matter.
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.
For example, a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information, and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere.
Let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now.
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries.
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.
This is the result of computational geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning.
This is a victory of thousands of users, in hundreds of cities, one user, one edit at a time.
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.
Welcome to the new world.

<title>Nathan Myhrvold: Cooking as never seen before</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Cookbook author Nathan Myhrvold talks about his magisterial work, "Modernist Cuisine" -- and shares the secret of its cool photographic illustrations, which show cross-sections of food in the very act of being cooked.</description>
So I'm going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food.
I've been interested in food for a long time.
I taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this.
I went to chef school in France.
And there is a way the world both envisions food, the way the world writes about food and learns about food.
And it's largely what you would find in these books.
And it's a wonderful thing.
But there's some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established.
In the last 20 years, people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food.
In fact, understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking -- some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.
But that's not in any of those books.
There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed, some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.
There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.
He's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.
A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal, he's developed his avant-garde cuisine.
None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books.
None of them are taught in cooking schools.
In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.
And finally, there's the old way of viewing food is the old way.
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually -- I set out to say, is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder?
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before?
So we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.
This is a picture called a cutaway.
This is actually the first picture I took in the book.
The idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli.
And this magic view allows you to see all of what's happening while the broccoli steams.
Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact.
And the hope was two-fold.
One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.
But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical, maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y than they otherwise would have.
Because with that beautiful photo, maybe I can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time.
Steaming ought to be faster.
It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation, and this explains that.
Well, that first cutaway picture worked, so we said, "Okay, let's do some more."
So here's another one.
We discovered why woks are the shape they are.
This shaped wok doesn't work very well; this caught fire three times.
But we had a philosophy, which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second.
And one of our canning cutaways.
Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away, so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.
And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on.
In this case, boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic.
You don't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.
So this is great for pickled vegetables, which is what we're canning here.
Here's our hamburger cutaway.
One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish.
So you can lavish all the same care, all the same technique, on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish.
And if you do lavish as much technique as possible, and you try to make the highest quality hamburger, it gets to be a little bit involved.
The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer."
Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe, if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff, it does take about 30 hours.
Of course, you're not actually working the whole time.
Most of the time is kind of sitting there.
The point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers, because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry -- in particular, those flames underneath the burger.
Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.
So it's the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste.
Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?
Most people assume we use Photoshop.
And the answer is: no, not really; we use a machine shop.
And it turns out, the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half.
So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.
We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.
The manufacturer said, "What would it take for you to cut one in half?"
I said, "It would have to show up free."
And so it showed up, we used it a little while, we cut it in half.
Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.
We would glue a piece of Pyrex or heat-resistant glass in front.
We used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.
The great thing is, when you cut something in half, you have another half.
So you photograph that in exactly the same position, and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges.
So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air, supported by wires, and then they take the wires away digitally so you're flying through the air.
In most cases, though, there was no glass.
Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.
And so those coals that kept falling off the edge, we kept having to put them back up.
But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.
The wok shot caught fire three times.
What happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh!
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.
But hey, they grow back.
In addition to cutaways, we also explain physics.
This is Fourier's law of heat conduction.
It's a partial differential equation.
We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it.
But to make them palatable, we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this.
We've got lots of little tidbits in the book.
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage, right?
But you probably don't know that much about James Watt.
But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.
It's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt, and where he got his inspiration.
It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey.
We also did a lot of calculation.
I personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook.
Here's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue, or other radiant heat source, goes as you move away from it.
So as you move vertically away from this surface, the heat falls off.
As you move side to side, it moves off.
That horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot.
That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.
So that's the place where you really want to cook.
And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing, which as far as I know, again, the first cookbook to ever do this.
Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.
You know, there's two ways you can make a product.
You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want, or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it.
Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.
If you really want great hamburger, it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.
And it's really simple, as you can see here.
As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray, and you just take it off in little passes, build it up, slice it vertically.
Here's the final hamburger.
This is the 30-hour hamburger.
We make every aspect of this burger.
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.
We also have things about how to make the bun.
There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on.
Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics.
Isn't that beautiful?
We have a very high-speed camera, which we had lots of fun with on the book.
The key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of 1,600.
That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.
So it's a great illustration of that.
Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.
We have a chapter on gels.
And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI, I thought, well, let's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin.
Well, if you have a high-speed camera, and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around, pretty soon somebody does this.
Now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that's why you shouldn't get shot.
The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down, it falls back down as a nice block.
Anyway, here's the book.
Here it is.
2,438 pages.
And they're nice big pages too.
A friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen, so there's a sixth volume that has washable, waterproof paper.

<title>Brian Greene: Is our universe the only universe?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Is there more than one universe? In this visually rich, action-packed talk, Brian Greene shows how the unanswered questions of physics have led to the theory that our own universe is just one of many in the "multiverse."</description>
A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever.
And today, after briefly describing what they found, I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery, namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth, the Milky Way and other distant galaxies, we may find that our universe is not the only universe, but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse.
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.
I mean, most of us were raised to believe that the word "universe" means everything.
And I say most of us with forethought, as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.
And last year I was holding her and I said, "Sophia, I love you more than anything in the universe."
And she turned to me and said, "Daddy, universe or multiverse?"
But barring such an anomalous upbringing, it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes of their own.
And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously, as it just might be right.
I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.
In part one, I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed.
In part two, I'll offer a solution to that mystery.
It's based on an approach called string theory, and that's where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story.
Finally, in part three, I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation, which will pull all the pieces of the story together.
Okay, part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us, establishing that space itself is stretching, it's expanding.
Now this was revolutionary.
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static.
But even so, there was one thing that everyone was certain of: The expansion must be slowing down.
That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward, the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space.
Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing.
And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies, allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time.
Here's the surprise: They found that the expansion is not slowing down.
Instead they found that it's speeding up, going faster and faster.
That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster.
Now if you saw an apple do that, you'd want to know why.
What's pushing on it?
Similarly, the astronomers' results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize, but they raised an analogous question.
What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed?
Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein's.
You see, we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing, pulls objects together.
But in Einstein's theory of gravity, his general theory of relativity, gravity can also push things apart.
How? Well according to Einstein's math, if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy, sort of like a uniform, invisible mist, then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive, repulsive gravity, which is just what we need to explain the observations.
Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space -- we now call it dark energy, but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it -- its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other, driving expansion to speed up, not slow down.
And this explanation represents great progress.
But I promised you a mystery here in part one.
Here it is.
When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found.
This number is small.
Expressed in the relevant unit, it is spectacularly small.
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.
We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics, but so far no one has found a way to do that.
Now you might wonder, should you care?
Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail of interest to experts, but of no relevance to anybody else.
Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter.
Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality, and this peculiar number may be doing just that, as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes -- an idea that naturally emerges from string theory, which takes me to part two: string theory.
So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory.
First off, what is it?
Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics, a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe.
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward.
It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely, at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.
But the theory says that if you could probe smaller, much smaller than we can with existing technology, you'd find something else inside these particles -- a little tiny vibrating filament of energy, a little tiny vibrating string.
And just like the strings on a violin, they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes.
These little fundamental strings, when they vibrate in different patterns, they produce different kinds of particles -- so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons, all other particles would be united into a single framework, as they would all arise from vibrating strings.
It's a compelling picture, a kind of cosmic symphony, where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little, tiny strings can play.
But there's a cost to this elegant unification, because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.
It has internal inconsistencies, unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space.
That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.
And you can think about those as height, width and depth.
But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales, there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them.
But even though the dimensions are hidden, they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate.
And in string theory, vibration determines everything.
So particle masses, the strengths of forces, and most importantly, the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions.
So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions, we should be able to calculate these features, calculate the amount of dark energy.
The challenge is we don't know the shape of the extra dimensions.
All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math.
Now when these ideas were first developed, there were only about five different candidate shapes, so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe.
But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes.
From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands -- A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze, since after all, graduate students need something to do.
But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions, until today.
The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500.
So, what to do?
Well some researchers lost heart, concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions, each giving rise to different physical features, string theory would never make definitive, testable predictions.
But others turned this issue on its head, taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.
Here's the idea.
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.
Each is as real as every other, in the sense that there are many universes, each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.
And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery: the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.
Because you see, if there are other universes, and if those universes each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions, then the physical features of each universe will be different, and in particular, the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different.
Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured would take on a wholly different character.
In this context, the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number, there are many numbers.
Which means we have been asking the wrong question.
It's that the right question to ask is, why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured instead of any of the other possibilities And that's a question on which we can make headway.
Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours, whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies, the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don't form.
And in those universes that have much less dark energy, well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that, again, galaxies don't form.
And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes.
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life.
And that would be that.
Mystery solved, multiverse found.
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.
We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.
But the point is, if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality, then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided.
An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.
And he worked for decades trying to explain this number, but he never succeeded, and we know why.
Kepler was asking the wrong question.
We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.
So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded.
Instead the right question to ask is, why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance, instead of any of the other possibilities?
And again, that's a question we can answer.
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn't exist.
And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they're so cold that, again, our form of life would not take hold.
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life.
And when it comes to planets and their distances, this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.
The point is, when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain, it may also be the right kind of reasoning.
One key difference, of course, is we know that there are other planets out there, but so far I've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes.
So to pull it all together, we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes.
And that takes me to my final part, part three.
Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.
You see, when we speak of the Big Bang, we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward.
But there's a little secret.
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important, the Bang.
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself.
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
It's called inflationary cosmology, which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space.
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up, which means in the inflationary theory, the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event.
Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang, but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs, each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.
And now, when we meld this with string theory, here's the picture we're led to.
Each of these universes has extra dimensions.
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.
The different shapes yield different physical features.
And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it's only in our universe that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy, are right for our form of life to take hold.
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider.
One big remaining question, of course, is, could we ever confirm the existence of other universes?
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen.
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support.
Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded, tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world, yielding a distinctive fingerprint, a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots, across space, which powerful telescopes have now observed.
Going further, if there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide.
And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded in observations, establishing the existence of other universes.
I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future.
You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expanding, that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies.
But because the expansion is speeding up, in the very far future, those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won't be able to see them -- not because of technological limitations, but because of the laws of physics.
The light those galaxies emit, even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light, will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us.
So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static, inky, black stillness.
And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit -- a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong.
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era, like ours, attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies.
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge?
Or would they believe in the black, static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?
I suspect the latter.
Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration.
It appears that it may not always be that way.
Because today's astronomers, by turning powerful telescopes to the sky, have captured a handful of starkly informative photons -- a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit.
and the message echoing across the ages is clear.
Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law.
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you.
The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.
How do you think of where cosmology is now, in a sort of historical side?
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?
BG: Well it's hard to say.
When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out, the natural question is, maybe we're already in that position and certain deep, critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves.
So from that perspective, maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them.
On the other hand, we now can understand how old the universe is.
We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago -- and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches.
Holy cow! That's just amazing.
So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten, but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.
CA: You're going to be around for the next few days.
Maybe some of these conversations can continue.
Thank you. Thank you, Brian.

<title>Michael Tilson Thomas: Music and emotion through time</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this epic overview, Michael Tilson Thomas traces the development of classical music through the development of written notation, the record, and the re-mix.</description>
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled, because, you see, my father's name was Ted, and much of my life, especially my musical life, is really a talk that I'm still having with him, or the part of me that he continues to be.
Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy, and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.
He didn't read a note, and he was profoundly hearing impaired.
Yet, he was my greatest teacher.
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids, his understanding of music was profound.
And for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.
And he did a painting of this experience, which he called "In the Realm of Music."
Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.
But he was tough when it came to music.
He said, "There are only two things that matter in music: what and how.
And the thing about classical music, that what and how, it's inexhaustible."
That was his passion for the music.
Both my parents really loved it.
They didn't know all that much about it, but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them.
And I think inspired by that memory, it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can, sort of pass it on through whatever means.
And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives, really fascinates me.
One day in New York, I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.
And a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat, and he took a swing and really connected.
And he watched the ball fly for a second, and then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.
Brah dada dadadadah."
And he ran around the bases.
And I thought, go figure.
How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid?
How was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?
Well when it comes to classical music, there's an awful lot to pass on, much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.
Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over 1,000 years.
And every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive.
Now the raw material of it, of course, is just the music of everyday life.
It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches.
But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down, to condense them to their absolute essence, and from that essence create a new language, a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are.
It's a language that's still evolving.
Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of, like concertos and symphonies, but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment -- like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
It's so simple, so evocative.
So many emotions seem to be inside of it.
Yet, of course, like all music, it's essentially not about anything.
It's just a design of pitches and silence and time.
And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.
They're locations in the spectrum of sound.
And whether we call them 440 per second, A, or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right -- they're just phenomena.
But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood.
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries, as have our preferences for them.
So for example, in the 11th century, people liked pieces that ended like this.
And in the 17th century, it was more like this.
And in the 21st century ...
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord, even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room.
And the reason you like it is because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not, centuries-worth of changes in musical theory, practice and fashion.
And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner, the way it's been passed on: notation.
Now the impulse to notate, or, more exactly I should say, encode music In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks.
And a thousand years later, this impulse to notate took an entirely different form.
And you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass "Puer Natus est nobis," "For Us is Born."
In the 10th century, little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune.
And in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line, to better pinpoint the pitch's location.
And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly, and that led to the kind of notation we have today.
Well notation not only passed the music on, notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely, because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale.
Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized, made into intricate designs.
And from this moment, classical music became what it most essentially is, a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature: instinct and intelligence.
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition.
Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move, but a composer is considering all possible moves, testing them out, prioritizing them out, until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness.
Now some of the greatest composers, like Bach, were combinations of these two things.
Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.
Mozart was the same way.
But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.
And every musical era had different priorities of these things, different things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God.
And by the 1400s, music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky.
The 'how' was a style called polyphony, music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe.
This was truly the music of the spheres.
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.
And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen -- a radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.
Singer: Ah, bitter blow!
Ah, wicked, cruel fate!
Ah, baleful stars!
Ah, avaricious heaven!
MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera, and its development put music on a radical new course.
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God, but to follow the emotion turbulence of man.
And the how was harmony, stacking up the pitches to form chords.
And the chords, it turned out, were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.
And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us, the triads, either the major one, which we think is happy, or the minor one, which we perceive as sad.
But what's the actual difference between these two chords?
It's just these two notes in the middle.
It's either E natural, and 659 vibrations per second, or E flat, at 622.
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness?
37 freakin' vibrations.
So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions.
And in fact, as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature, harmony grew more complex to reflect it.
Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words.
Now with all this possibility, classical music really took off.
It's the time in which the big forms began to arise.
And the effects of technology began to be felt also, because printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music, into the hands of performers everywhere.
And new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible.
This is when those big forms arose -- the symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.
And in these big architectures of time, composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.
A piece like Beethoven's Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger, over the course of a half an hour, step by exacting step of his route, to the moment when he could make it across to joy.
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues, like gripping ones of culture, such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality.
But whatever direction the music took, one thing until recently was always the same, and that was when the musicians stopped playing, the music stopped.
Now this moment so fascinates me.
I find it such a profound one.
What happens when the music stops?
Where does it go? What's left?
What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?
Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?
And how might that change their lives?
To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.
It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.
And to me that's the most essential of all.
Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing, a teacher-student, performer-audience thing, and then around 1880 came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on, albeit an impersonal one.
People could now hear music all the time, even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.
And technology democratized music by making everything available.
It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.
And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes, using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences.
At the same time technology, by taking over the role that notation had always played, shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side.
The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced, diced, layered and, God knows, distributed and sold.
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?
Nobody knows.
The question remains: What happens when the music stops?
What sticks with people?
Now that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?
Well let me show you a story of what I mean by "really sticking with us."
I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home, and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker.
He came over to a piano that was there, and he balanced himself and began playing something like this.
And he said something like, "Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."
And I suddenly got it, and I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"
And he said, "Yes, yes. I was a little boy.
The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."
And I thought, my God, how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room to recover the memory of this music that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away, still means so much to him?
Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously, why it matters to me so much.
I never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life.
But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music.
That's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music, and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education.
And of course, the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers, parents, performers -- to be explorers together.
Sure, the big events attract a lot of attention, but what really matters is what goes on every single day.
We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.
And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers, people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on.
You don't need to worry about knowing anything.
If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive, you know all that you need to know.
You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.
Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.
All that 'what', all that 'how' is out there waiting for you to discover its 'why', to dive in and pass it on.
Thank you.

<title>Boghuma Kabisen Titanji: Ethical riddles in HIV research</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: It’s an all too common story: after participating in an HIV clinical trial, a woman in sub-Saharan Africa is left without the resources to buy a bus ticket to her health clinic, let alone to afford life-saving antiretrovirals. Boghuma Kabisen Titanji asks an important question: how can researchers looking for a cure make sure they’re not taking advantage of those most affected by the pandemic? </description>
I'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called Celine.
Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of Cameroon in west Central Africa.
Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis, she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time.
When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago, she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy, and she was very ill.
She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.
Now during the clinical trial, she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge, and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds.
All of these ended once the trial was completed, leaving Celine with no alternatives.
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial, or even what the trial had been about.
I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.
Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.
Now, I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted.
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.
But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who, like Celine, were left to their own devices once the research had been completed.
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is bad.
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools, and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries.
However, the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation, especially in the context of externally-funded research.
Sadly enough, the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research.
I'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results, they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections.
Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description, with 22 million people living with HIV, an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide.
Also, research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty, endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.
A clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized, and in the absence of good health care systems, almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing.
Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation, less rigorous ethical reviews, and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure.
As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict, you can see why this context becomes very, very attractive.
The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable.
How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure, we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic?
I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done.
The first of these is informed consent.
Now, in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable, participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand, and must freely consent to participate in the trial.
This is especially important in developing countries, where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits.
Consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries.
For example, it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant, like Celine, sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read, let alone understand.
Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.
The information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.
The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial.
Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.
Should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world?
Or should they be given an alternative standard of care, such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted?
Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed?
Now, in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver, the answer is straightforward.
However, the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries.
It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial, and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study.
That brings us to the third point I want you think about: the ethical review of research.
An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial.
Unfortunately, this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries.
Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries, and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors.
Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate.
The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed.
I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended.
Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed.
In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends.
If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible, then I think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.
Now, fortunately for Celine, our meeting did not end in my office.
I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program closer to her home, and with a support group to help her cope.
Her story has a positive ending, but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate.
Although she may not know this, my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries, and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done.
I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change.
If you are a researcher, I hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience, to remain ethical in your research, and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.
If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company, I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound.
If you come from a developing country like myself, I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country.
Yes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV, to find an effective vaccine for malaria, to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B., but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way.
Thank you.

<title>Jared Diamond: How societies can grow old better</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: There's an irony behind the latest efforts to extend human life: It's no picnic to be an old person in a youth-oriented society. Older people can become isolated, lacking meaningful work and low on funds. In this intriguing talk, Jared Diamond looks at how many different societies treat their elders -- some better, some worse -- and suggests we all take advantage of experience.</description>
To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I'm about to tell you of practical value, let me ask you please to raise your hands: Who here is either over 65 years old or hopes to live past age 65 or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past 65, raise your hands please.
Okay. You are the people to whom my talk The rest of you won't find my talk personally relevant, but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating.
I'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies.
This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book, which compares traditional, small, tribal societies with our large, modern societies, with respect to many topics such as bringing up children, growing older, health, dealing with danger, settling disputes, religion and speaking more than one language.
Those tribal societies, which constituted all human societies for most of human history, are far more diverse than are our modern, recent, big societies.
All big societies that have governments, and where most people are strangers to each other, are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies.
Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society.
They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn.
Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned as primitive and miserable, but also they shouldn't be romanticized as happy and peaceful.
When we learn of tribal practices, but there are other tribal practices which, when we hear about them, we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves.
Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years, and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly, whereas in traditional societies, older people instead live out their lives among their children, their other relatives, and their lifelong friends.
Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies, from much worse to much better than in our modern societies.
At the worst extreme, many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways: by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die, or by abandoning them when the group moves, or by encouraging older people to commit suicide, or by killing older people.
In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents?
It happens mainly under two conditions.
One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can't walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions.
The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments, such as the Arctic or deserts, where there are periodic food shortages, and occasionally there just isn't enough food to keep everyone alive.
Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able-bodied adults and for children.
To us Americans, it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father, but what could those traditional societies do differently?
They face a cruel situation of no choice.
Their old people had to do it to their own parents, and the old people know what now is going to happen to them.
At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme, are the New Guinea farming societies where I've been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years, and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world.
In those societies, older people are cared for.
They are fed. They remain valuable.
And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children, relatives and lifelong friends.
There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people.
The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society's values.
First, as regards usefulness, older people continue to perform useful services.
One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food.
Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren, thereby freeing up their own adult children, the parents of those grandchildren, to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren.
Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools, weapons, baskets, pots and textiles.
In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.
Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies, and the people most knowledgeable about politics, medicine, religion, songs and dances.
Finally, older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern, literate societies, where our sources of information are books and the Internet.
In contrast, in traditional societies without writing, older people are the repositories of information.
It's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience.
Those, then, are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies.
Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society's treatment of the elderly.
The other set of reasons for variation the society's cultural values.
For example, there's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia, associated with Confucius' doctrine of filial piety, which means obedience, respect and support for elderly parents.
Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S.
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications.
They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.
Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources.
That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited, for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant, or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients, American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them, even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them.
There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S.
One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work, so older people who are no longer working aren't respected.
Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence, so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent.
Still a third reason is our American cult of youth, which shows up even in our advertisements.
Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people, even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.
Just think, what's the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old? Never.
Instead, the only American ads featuring white-haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.
Well, what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies?
There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse.
Big changes for the better much longer lives, much better health in our old age, and much better recreational opportunities.
Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people.
Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past.
That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people, and that each old person has less individual value.
Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age, because older people, their children, and their friends, all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives.
We Americans move on the average every five years.
Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth.
Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce, carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.
Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies.
Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge.
When we want some information, we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask.
The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old, but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later.
And conversely, we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society.
For example, as a 15-year-old, I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.
Today, though, those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.
Conversely, I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life.
My family's first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered: an on-off switch, a volume knob, and a channel selector knob.
Today, just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house, I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me.
I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.
What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S., and to make better use of their value?
That's a huge problem.
In my remaining four minutes today, I can offer just a few suggestions.
One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it, as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children.
Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers, grandparents offer superior, motivated, experienced child care.
They've already gained experience from raising their own children.
They usually love their grandchildren, and are eager to spend time with them.
Unlike other caregivers, grandparents don't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby.
A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology.
At the same time, older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change, but that could come back.
For example, only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression, the experience of living through a world war, and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs.
Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things, but millions of older Americans do.
Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations could come back.
Even if they don't come back, we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like.
Older people have that experience.
Younger people don't.
The remaining value of older people that I'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do, there are other things that they can do better than younger people.
A challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing.
Some abilities, of course, decrease with age.
Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina, ambition, and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation, such as figuring out the structure of DNA, best left to scientists under the age of 30.
Conversely, valuable attributes that increase with age include experience, understanding of people and human relationships, ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way, and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases, such as economics and comparative history, best left to scholars over the age of 60.
Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising, administering, advising, strategizing, teaching, synthesizing, and devising long-term plans.
I've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, who are still active as investment managers, farmers, lawyers and doctors.
In short, many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern, big societies.
Paradoxically nowadays, when we have more elderly people than ever before, living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before, old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before.
The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society.
We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies.
But what's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well.
Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small, traditional societies.
To mention just a few examples, our lives are longer, materially much richer, and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies.
But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies, and perhaps to be learned from them.
Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer.
Their children are more self-confident, more independent, and more socially skilled than are our children.
They think more realistically about dangers than we do.
They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today.
Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases, and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them.
Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies.
I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies.
Thank you.

<title>Jae Rhim Lee: My mushroom burial suit</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Here's a powerful provocation from artist Jae Rhim Lee. Can we commit our bodies to a cleaner, greener Earth, even after death? Naturally -- using a special burial suit seeded with pollution-gobbling mushrooms. Yes, this just might be the strangest TEDTalk you'll ever see ...</description>
So I'm here to explain why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.
And to do that, I'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies.
So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.
It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics.
So BPA mimics the body's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems.
And it's everywhere.
A recent study found BPA in 93 percent of people six and older.
But it's just one chemical.
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies, and this includes preservatives, pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury.
To me, this says three things.
First, don't become a cannibal.
Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution.
And third, our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins.
So what happens to all these toxins when we die?
The short answer is: They return to the environment in one way or another, continuing the cycle of toxicity.
But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse.
If you're cremated, all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year.
And in a traditional American funeral, a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive.
It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition -- a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel.
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies, we deny death, poison the living and further harm the environment.
Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming, are a step in the right direction, but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.
I think there's a better solution.
I'm an artist, so I'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art, science and culture.
The Infinity Burial Project, an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom -- a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots, leaving clean compost.
But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom.
I also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil.
So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body.
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off -- my hair, skin and nails -- and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.
As the mushrooms grow, I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms.
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife.
So when I die, the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it.
All right, so for some of you, this may be really, really out there.
Just a little.
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food.
We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.
But as I watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body, I imagine the Infinity Mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment.
See for me, cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet, it's a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay.
It's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet.
Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture, a concept that was developed by an entomologist, Timothy Myles.
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
And now about these ninja pajamas.
Once it's completed, I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.
First, a burial suit infused with mushroom spores, the Mushroom Death Suit.
I'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit.
It's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores.
The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia, which are the equivalent of plant roots.
I'm also making a decompiculture kit, a cocktail of capsules that contain Infinity Mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation.
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly, a kind of second skin, which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two, and then I'd like to begin testing them, first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects.
And believe it or not, a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms.
What I've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.
I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms, so I formed the Decompiculture Society, a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options, seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom.
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift, from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture, a radical acceptance of death and decomposition.
Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment, as the research on environmental toxins confirms.
And the saying goes, we came from dust and will return to dust.
And once we understand that we're connected to the environment, we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet.
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility.
Thank you.

<title>Jonathan Klein: Photos that changed the world</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Photographs do more than document history -- they make it. At TED University, Jonathan Klein of Getty Images shows some of the most iconic, and talks about what happens when a generation sees an image so powerful it can't look away -- or back.</description>
In my industry, we believe that images can change the world.
Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world, but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography, images have provoked reactions in people, and those reactions have caused change to happen.
So let's begin with a group of images.
I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them.
They're best described as iconic: so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.
In fact, they're so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form.
But I think we're looking for something more.
We're looking for something more.
We're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues, images that transcend borders, that transcend religions, images that provoke us to step up and do something -- in other words, to act.
Well, this image you've all seen.
It changed our view of the physical world.
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.
Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its smallness, its fragility.
Forty years later, this group, more than most, are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment.
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.
This destructive power takes many different forms.
For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo.
These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified, and unsurprisingly, they sparked international outrage.
Most recently, we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti.
Well, I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man.
Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said, and I'll quote him, "The Holocaust teaches us that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man, when he loses his moral compass and his reason."
There's another kind of crucifixion.
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact.
The publication of those images, as opposed to the images themselves, caused a government to change its policies.
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act.
Furthermore, those images forever removed the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.
Let's go back a little.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in, day out.
News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm, a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.
In fact, these images became the voices of protest themselves.
Now, images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion, ignorance, and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image -- the issue of HIV/AIDS.
In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease to even discussing or addressing it.
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world, the Princess of Wales, touching an HIV/AIDS infected baby did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.
She, better than most, knew the power of an image.
So when we are confronted by a powerful image, we all have a choice: We can look away, or we can address the image.
Thankfully, when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998, they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.
Did the images change the world?
No, but they had a major impact.
Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other.
We all saw those images after Katrina, and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact.
And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November 2008.
Unfortunately, some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.
I'll show you one photo here, and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work, which has never been published, called War Is Personal.
But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world, there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still, much more than the others.
Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him, "You don't take a photograph, you make it."
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo, it's you.
We bring to each image our own values, our own belief systems, and as a result of that, the image resonates with us.
My company has 70 million images.
I have one image in my office.
Here it is.
I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you, you'll better understand why, and I know that speaking to this audience, you'll definitely do something about it.
And thank you to all the photographers.

<title>Doris Kearns Goodwin: Lessons from past presidents</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin talks about what we can learn from American presidents, including Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. Then she shares a moving memory of her own father, and of their shared love of baseball.</description>
So, indeed, I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.
Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning, thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.
But when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.
He taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms: work, love and play.
And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other, is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication, is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement, but with serenity.
So since I tell stories, let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point -- Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.
As for that first sphere of work, I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing.
He had a huge ambition.
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.
Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.
He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm from which he was born.
No schooling was possible for him, except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.
But he read books in every spare moment he could find.
It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.
He couldn't eat.
The great poet Emily Dickinson once said, "There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."
How true for Lincoln.
Though he never would travel to Europe, he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England, he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.
Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.
But there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death.
His mother died when he was only nine years old; his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later; and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.
Moreover, when his mother lay dying, she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld.
She simply said to him, "Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."
As a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.
But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion -- but followed by other cultures as well -- that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life, you could live on in the memory of others.
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s.
Three things had combined to lay him low.
He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd, not certain he was ready to marry her, but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.
His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.
And his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide.
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.
They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said, "Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."
He said that, "I would just as soon die right now, but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived."
So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.
He eventually won a seat in Congress.
He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said, "but some people are stronger in the broken places."
So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced, far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.
And then when he won the general election, he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought, "He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."
They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"
He said, "Look, these are the strongest and most able men in the country.
The country is in peril. I need them by my side."
But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion: "Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in."
But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.
For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.
For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.
He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility.
He shared credit with ease, assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates, constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.
He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.
And he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul.
In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House, and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.
And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said, "I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."
But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.
So he put the pen down.
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.
But if I sign with a shaking hand, posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'" So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand.
But even in his wildest dreams, Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach.
I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.
And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus, where there were only wild barbarians, who had never left this part of Russia.
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst, they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.
So he said, "I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar, and they loved it.
But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said, 'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder, who laughed like the sunrise, who came from that place called America, which is so far from here, that if a young man should travel there, he would be an old man when he arrived.
Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'" He was stunned.
He told them everything he could about Lincoln.
And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?
Not as great a general as Napoleon, not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."
But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree, in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being.
So in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself, to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war.
His story would be told.
So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love -- encompassing family, friends and colleagues -- it, too, takes work and commitment.
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life, when I helped him on his memoirs, was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work, power and individual success, that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone.
My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.
I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.
We had a big dance at the White House.
President Johnson did dance with me that night.
Not that peculiar -- there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House.
But it was not to be that simple.
For in the months leading up to my selection, like many young people, I'd been active in the anti-Vietnam War movement, and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson, which unfortunately came out in The New Republic two days after the dance in the White House.
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.
But instead, surprisingly, he said, "Oh, bring her down here for a year, and if I can't win her over, no one can."
So I did end up working for him in the White House.
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs, never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.
I like to believe it was because I was a good listener.
He was a great storyteller.
Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.
There was a problem with these stories, however, which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.
But they were great, nonetheless.
So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.
So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends, even when I didn't have any at all.
Everything was working perfectly, until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.
Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake, conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings.
And he started out, "Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... " And my heart sank.
And then he said, "You remind me of my mother."
It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.
But I must say, the older I've gotten, the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.
A victor in a thousand contests, three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.
And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure, that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.
But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life.
For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years, in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency; he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted; he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city, sailboats, speedboats.
He had servants to answer any whim, and he had a family who loved him deeply.
And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.
It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.
As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.
In those last years, he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice, saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children, and their children in turn.
But it was too late.
Despite all that power, all that wealth, he was alone when he finally died -- his ultimate terror realized.
So as for that third sphere of play, which he never had learned to enjoy, I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy -- enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music, or art, or literature, or any form of recreation, can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare, that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater, even during those dark days of the war.
He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on, for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time.
But an even more important form of relaxation for him, that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy, was a love of -- somehow -- humor, and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness.
He once said that he laughed so he did not cry, that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.
His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois.
The lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other, and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town, they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.
He would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.
And all these stories became part of his memory bank, so he could call on them whenever he needed to.
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.
One of his favorite stories, for example, had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.
And as Lincoln told the story, Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.
And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution, so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.
They figured he'd be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse.
But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.
And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"
"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."
"What do you mean?" they said.
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington."
So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to relax.
So between his nightly treks to the theater, his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry, he found that form of play which carried him through his days.
In my own life, I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.
Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall, to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work.
It all began when I was only six years old, and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games -- so that when he went to work in New York during the day, I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game.
Now, when you're only six years old, and your father comes home every single night and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail, recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon.
But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.
It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention.
In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father.
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out, "The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"
Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.
So I finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end.
I must say, so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball.
The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella, came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island, just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.
And I was so excited -- first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.
When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church, you'll be struck dead at the threshold.
So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.
We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.
It's not a sin."
But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella.
And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.
So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.
I told the priest right away.
He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."
But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"
And then came my second sin.
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church, wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.
And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"
And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players would break arms, legs and ankles -- -- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.
He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"
And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.
So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do, but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.
You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."
"Oh yes," I said.
But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!
Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s, before I had gotten married and had my three sons, I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.
Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A., I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston and became an irrational Red Socks fan.
And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons with our season tickets, I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father, watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below: Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.
I must say there is magic in these moments.
When I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat, I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see, but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told.
Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history, allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.
Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life.
Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families, and the public figures we have respected in our history, just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe, really can live on, so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.
Thank you.

<title>John Hunter: Teaching with the World Peace Game</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: John Hunter puts all the problems of the world on a 4'x5' plywood board -- and lets his 4th-graders solve them. At TED2011, he explains how his World Peace Game engages schoolkids, and why the complex lessons it teaches -- spontaneous, and always surprising -- go further than classroom lectures can.</description>
I'm very fortunate to be here.
I feel so fortunate.
I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.
I called my wife Leslie, and I said, "You know, there's so many good people trying to do so much good.
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."
It's a true feeling.
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running.
I'm a public school teacher, and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County, Virginia, the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
And she's a very high-tech superintendent.
She uses smart boards, she blogs, she Tweets, she does Facebook, she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.
She's a technology leader and instructional leader.
But in her office, there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table -- peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.
And I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.
Why is this old table in your office?"
And she told me, she said, "You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia, in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia, and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.
And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working, and we'd sit around that table every night.
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table.
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him.
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."
The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game, and essentially it is also an empty space.
And I'd like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table, really.
It all started back in 1977.
I was a young man, and I had been dropping in and out of college.
And my parents were very patient, but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest.
And I remember the last time I came back from India -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses -- and I said to my father, "Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment."
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find."
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education.
It was an experimental education program.
It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it, and so that's what I had to go for.
And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city, bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention -- kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s -- and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro, said I had the job teaching gifted children.
And I was so shocked, so stunned, I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?"
Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much.
There weren't really many materials or things to use.
And I said, "What do I do?"
And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.
Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that.
She said, "What do you want to do?"
And that question cleared the space.
There was no program directive, no manual to follow, no standards in gifted education in that way.
And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students, an empty space, whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding.
So this happened in 1978, and I was teaching many years later, and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.
His name is Chris Farina.
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you -- a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.
This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements."
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.
He proposed the film to me, and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV, and we can say hi to our friends."
But the film has really gone places.
Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice, to get this film out.
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me, more than a story about one teacher.
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.
And it's a beautiful thing.
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film -- I have the eerie sensation of seeing it -- I saw myself literally disappear.
What I saw was my teachers coming through me.
I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's wry smile under his handlebar mustache.
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile.
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.
And they weren't flashing in anger, they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.
And I have that kind of flash sometimes.
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.
You know the one.
"And I'm not even talking about you behind me, because I've got eyes in the back of my head."
You know that teacher?
I didn't use that stare very often, but I do have it in my repertoire.
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.
And then I saw my own parents, my first teachers.
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker.
That's my brother Malcolm there on the right.
And my mother, who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia, who was my inspiration.
And really, I feel as though, when I see the film -- I have a gesture she does, like this -- I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.
I am one of her teaching gestures.
And the beautiful thing was, I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.
And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations.
It's an amazing feeling to have that lineage.
And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.
I'm not here alone.
There are many people on this stage right now.
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.
It started out like this: it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school, 1978.
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.
We put all the problems of the world there, and I thought, let's let them solve it.
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.
So I thought, well they like to play games.
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive; we didn't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive.
And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure.
And it has four Plexiglass layers.
There's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining.
There's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces, a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it -- even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining.
There are four countries around the board.
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor.
They have different assets, commercial and military.
And each country has a cabinet.
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense and a CFO, or Comptroller.
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.
I offer them the job, they can turn it down, and then they choose their own cabinet.
There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.
There's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather.
That's not all.
And then there's a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems.
So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.
I throw them into this complex matrix, and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.
And so with all these crises, we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions; we have chemical and nuclear spills, nuclear proliferation.
There's oil spills, environmental disasters, water rights disputes, breakaway republics, famine, endangered species and global warming.
If Al Gore is here, I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week.
And they've done it several times too.
So I also have in the game a saboteur -- some child -- it's basically a troublemaker -- and I have my troublemaker put to use because they, on the surface, are trying to save the world and their position in the game.
But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.
And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies, trying to cause everyone to think more deeply.
The saboteur is there, and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old -- and they handle that and use that to understand how to, not follow -- at first they do -- the paths to power and destruction, the path to war.
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking, to think in a long-term, more consequential way.
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force.
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.
I'm just a clock watcher.
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.
The students run the game.
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing.
So I'll just share with you ...
Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.
You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world.
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot, and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem.
John Hunter: I offered them a -- Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.
And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.
And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.
And so I apologize to them as well.
I say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls, but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape, and we hope you can fix it for us, and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it."
It's a sincere apology, and they take it very seriously.
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.
Well when we have the game start, here's what you see.
JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.
JH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom?
It's a serious question: who is really in charge?
I've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time.
There's a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don't have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher: control every conversation and response in the classroom.
It's impossible. Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine, and I admit it to them openly.
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened.
In this game we had a little girl, and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.
Without provocation, suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders, the next-door neighbor's oil fields.
She marched into the oil field reserves, surrounded it, without firing a shot, and secured it and held it.
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up.
We were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this?
This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?"
This was a little girl and, at nine years old, she held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing."
To her girlfriends she said that.
That's a breach there.
And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks.
They are the toughest opponents.
And we were very upset.
I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this?
But come to find out, a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team -- actually there's a negotiation period with all teams, and each team takes a turn, then we go back in negotiation, around and around, so each turn around is one game day.
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world.
Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game.
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war, so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right, conditional good, or not right.
That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.
I could not have designed that in teaching it.
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.
Another example, a beautiful thing happened.
We have a letter in the game.
If you're a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them, I put in a letter.
You have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences.
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat.
And so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually, at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter, let's ask -- there's a parent over there."
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.
It'll be more realer if she reads it."
So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.
"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.
She read two sentences.
By the third sentence, she was in tears.
I was in tears.
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.
We all lose.
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.
I'll show you what my friend David says about this.
He's been in many battles.
David: We've really had enough of people attacking.
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.
But now I'm feeling really weird because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.
One week he said, "Those who go into battle and win will want to go back, and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win."
And so I've been winning battles, so I'm going into battles, more battles.
And I think it's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said.
JH: I get chills every time I see that.
That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.
And I can't design that, I can't plan that, and I can't even test that.
But it's self-evident assessment.
We know that's an authentic assessment of learning.
We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on.
So I'll just share a third story.
This is about my friend Brennan.
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks, about seven weeks, and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country's asset value has to be increased above its starting point.
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.
He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away."
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him.
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer.
There was no way they could win.
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room.
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.
I should have gotten it so they could have won.
They shouldn't be failing like this.
I've failed them.
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected.
And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets, and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.
Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming; there was yelling, waving of their dossiers.
They get these dossiers full of secret documents.
They were gesticulating; they were running around.
I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.
Principal walks in, I'm out of a job.
The parents were looking in the window.
And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.
He rings the bell again. He says, "We have" -- and there's 12 seconds left on the clock -- "we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.
And we've got 600 billion dollars.
We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.
And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.
Will you accept it?"
And there are three seconds left on the clock.
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country, and he says, "Yes."
And the game is won.
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for, that was unexpected and unpredictable.
Every game we play is different.
Some games are more about social issues, some are more about economic issues.
Some games are more about warfare.
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.
I allow them to go there and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way, how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.
And they find out what is right their own way, their own selves.
And so in this game, I've learned so much from it, but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world, they may save us all.
If only.
And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I'm standing, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

<title>Clay Shirky: Institutions vs. collaboration</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this prescient 2005 talk, Clay Shirky shows how closed groups and companies will give way to looser networks where small contributors have big roles and fluid cooperation replaces rigid planning.</description>
How do groups get anything done? Right?
How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value, instead of just being chaos?
And the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs.
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output.
And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs, which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people, you start an institution, right? You raise some resources.
You found something. It can be private or public.
It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.
But you get these resources together.
You found an institution, and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group.
More recently, because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer, which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure, to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system, without regard to institutional models.
So, that's what I want to talk about today.
I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples, but always pointing to the broader themes.
So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other, and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer, which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid?
So, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer, Coney Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park, hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade; people come from all over the city; people get all dressed up.
Some people get less dressed up.
Young and old, dancing in the streets.
Colorful characters, and a good time is had by all.
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself, charming though it is, but rather to these photos.
I didn't take them. How did I get them?
And the answer is: I got them from Flickr.
Flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos, upload them, share them over the Web and so forth.
Recently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging.
Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter.
Delicious is a social bookmarking service.
Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.
Right? If I had given this talk last year, I couldn't do what I just did, because I couldn't have found those photos.
But instead of saying, we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they're uploaded, Flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos.
So, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged "Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers, all aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name, shown in reverse chronological order.
And I was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow.
Now, what hard problem is being solved here?
And it's -- in the most schematic possible view, it's a coordination problem, right?
There are a large number of people on the Internet, a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade.
How do we get those people together to contribute that work?
The classic answer is to form an institution, right?
To draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals.
And I want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route.
First of all, when you form an institution, you take on a management problem, right?
No good just hiring employees, you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.
Secondly, you have to bring structure into place.
Right? You have to have economic structure.
You have to have legal structure.
You have to have physical structure.
And that creates additional costs.
Third, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary.
You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo.
You can't hire everyone in a company, right?
You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization.
You have to exclude some people.
And fourth, as a result of that exclusion, you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here.
We've gone from people with photos to photographers.
Right? We've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade, or whatever else they're sent out to photograph.
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure, which is the Flickr answer, you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals, rather than moving the individuals to the problem.
You arrange the coordination in the group, and by doing that you get the same outcome, without the institutional difficulties.
You lose the institutional imperative.
You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort, but you also shed the institutional cost, which gives you greater flexibility.
What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination.
And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.
Right. You'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone, and you stopped making plans.
You just said, "I'll call you when I get there."
"Call me when you get off work." Right?
That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.
Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups.
To say instead of, we must make an advance plan, we must have a five-year projection of where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever, you can just say, let's coordinate the group effort, and let's deal with it as we go, because we're now well-enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do.
So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber.
These are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."
And everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the Mermaid Parade is even harder here.
There are more pictures. There are more photographers.
It's taken over a wider geographic area.
The photos are spread out over a longer period of time.
And worst of all, that figure at the bottom, approximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.
It's mathematically true, but it doesn't really talk about anything important -- because in these systems, the average isn't really what matters.
What matters is this.
This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.
And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer.
You can see here, over at the end, our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos, and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos.
Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos.
And by the time we get around here, we get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail.
And by the time you get to the middle, you've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each.
This is called a power-law distribution.
It appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like -- this is often what you get. Right?
The math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position is doing about one-nth of whatever's being measured, relative to the person in the first position.
So, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos, and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did.
So, the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter.
But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long, flat tail.
And curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger, the systems don't converge; they diverge more.
In bigger systems, the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases.
You can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily: if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system, they account for three quarters of the photos taken -- just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers.
If you go down to five percent, you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.
If you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort, you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.
And because of this left weighting, the average is actually here, way to the left.
And that sounds strange to our ears, but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a below-average amount.
That sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same, but they're not at all.
This is the math underlying the 80/20 rule. Right?
Whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule, this is what's going on. Right?
20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue, 20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources -- this is the shape people are talking about when that happens.
Institutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks.
And the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.
The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.
The institutional model always pushes leftwards, treating these people as employees.
The institutional response is, I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great, that's what I'll do.
The cooperative infrastructure model says, why do you want to give up a quarter of the value?
If your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value, re-engineer the system.
Don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people.
Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount.
So the coordination response asks not, how are these people as employees, but rather, what is their contribution like? Right?
We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user, who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."
And here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work."
Right? So the question is, do you want that photo? Yes or no.
The question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee?
And the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle.
When you're dealing with the left-hand edge of one of these distributions, when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want, that's an institution-as-enabler world.
You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work and you can get some output.
But when you're down here, where the Psycho Milts of the world are adding one photo at a time, that's institution as obstacle.
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles.
One of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self-preservation.
And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n.
Right? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles, and that there are other ways of coordinating the value, they go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages -- -- of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness: denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance.
Most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase.
Many, many institutions are still in denial, but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining.
There's a wonderful, small example going on right now.
In France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool, right, because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.
You can follow this in the Guardian.
It's actually quite entertaining.
The bigger question is, what do you do about the value down here?
Right? How do you capture that?
And institutions, as I've said, are prevented from capturing that.
Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft, was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said, "Oh, this business of thousands of programmers contributing to Linux, this is a myth.
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux, and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing." Right?
You can hear this distribution under that complaint.
And you can see why, from Ballmer's point of view, that's a bad idea, right?
We hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea.
Right? Bad hire. Right?
The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?
What if it was a security patch?
What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit, of which Windows has not some, [but] several?
Do you want that patch, right?
The fact that a single programmer can, without having to move into a professional relation to an institution, improve Linux once and never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer.
Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative systems of open-source software, of file sharing, of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr, but there are actually stories about this from all over.
Meetup, a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you.
When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup, he thought it would be used for, you know, train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups.
The inventors don't know what the invention is.
Number one group on Meetup right now, most chapters in most cities with most members, most active?
Stay-at-home moms. Right?
In the suburbanized, dual-income United States, stay-at-home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local, small-scale neighborhoods.
So they're reinventing it, using these tools.
Meetup is the platform, but the value here is in social infrastructure.
If you want to know what technology is going to change the world, don't pay attention to 13-year-old boys -- pay attention to young mothers, because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn't materially make their lives better.
This is so much more important than Xbox, but it's a lot less glitzy.
I think this is a revolution.
I think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged.
And I use that word advisedly.
It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium.
It's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides.
In the United States right now, a woman named Judith Miller is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources -- she's a reporter for the New York Times -- her sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case.
And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws.
The shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws -- that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.
This is happening, however, against the background of the rise of Web logging.
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.
It has de-professionalized publishing.
Want to publish globally anything you think today?
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free.
That has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization.
And so the shield law, as much as we want it -- we want a professional class of truth-tellers -- it is becoming increasingly incoherent, because the institution is becoming incoherent.
There are people in the States right now tying themselves into knots, trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists.
And the answer to that question is, it doesn't matter, because that's not the right question.
Journalism was an answer to an even more important question, which is, how will society be informed?
How will they share ideas and opinions?
And if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism, it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class.
So as much as we want the shield laws, the background -- the institution to which they were attached -- is becoming incoherent.
Here's another example.
Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups.
These are groups of teenage girls who have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards, other kinds of cooperative infrastructure, and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice.
They post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration."
They have little slogans, like "Salvation through Starvation."
They even have Lance Armstrong-style bracelets, these red bracelets, which signify, in the small group, I am trying to maintain my eating disorder.
They trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something, clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass.
We're used to support groups being beneficial.
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.
But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral.
A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group.
Now, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks, and the small group wants to stay sober, then we think, that's a great support group.
But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice, then we're horrified.
What's happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we're used to, came from the institutions that were framing them, and not from the infrastructure.
Once the infrastructure becomes generically available, the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals.
So, there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment, one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors trying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these.
This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9/11 attack.
It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.
Now, this is the part of the talk where I tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this, but I'm running out of time, which is good, because I don't know.
Right. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution, it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B.
It takes us from Point A to chaos.
The printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos, moving from a world where the Catholic Church was the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia, when we finally knew what the new unit was: the nation state.
Now, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50.
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage, and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives -- like deciding in advance what's going to happen, or the profit motive -- the more leverage they'll get.
And institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure, and the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely on information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be.
And that's going to happen one arena at a time, one institution at a time. The forces are general, but the results are going to be specific.
And so the point here is not, "This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework."
It's going to be much more complicated than that.
But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.
And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming, my argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it.
Thank you very much.

<title>Nic Marks: The Happy Planet Index</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Statistician Nic Marks asks why we measure a nation's success by its productivity -- instead of by the happiness and well-being of its people. He introduces the Happy Planet Index, which tracks national well-being against resource use . Which countries rank highest in the HPI? You might be surprised.</description>
Martin Luther King did not say, "I have a nightmare," when he inspired the civil rights movements.
He said, "I have a dream."
And I have a dream.
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare, and this is going to be a challenge, because, if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times, nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic.
I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking, but everything is desolate, everything is dead.
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road.
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future.
For too long, we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen.
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.
We have focused on the problems.
And we have not thought enough about the solutions.
We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention.
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism.
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism, that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer.
A deer freezes very, very still, poised to run away.
And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change.
People are freezing and running away because we're using fear.
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is.
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?
And one of the problems that we face, I think, is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is, an economic definition of what progress is -- that somehow, if we get the right numbers to go up, we're going to be better off, whether that's on the stock market, whether that's with GDP and economic growth, that somehow life is going to get better.
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better.
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations.
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system, Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s, said that, "A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income."
But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff.
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce.
But as early as 1968, this visionary man, Robert Kennedy, at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign, gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been.
And he finished his talk with the phrase, that, "The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile."
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress, our dominant measure of progress in society, is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile?
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today, he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile.
He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice, sustainability and people's well-being.
And actually, social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world.
This is from a global survey.
It's asking people, what do they want.
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world say that what they want is happiness, for themselves, for their families, their children, their communities.
Okay, they think money is slightly important.
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness, and it's not nearly as important as love.
We all need to love and be loved in life.
It's not nearly as important as health.
We want to be healthy and live a full life.
These seem to be natural human aspirations.
Why are statisticians not measuring these?
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms, instead of just how much stuff we have?
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness, how do we measure well-being, how can we do that within environmental limits.
And we created, at the organization that I work for, the New Economics Foundation, something we call the Happy Planet Index, because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
And what we do, is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet.
But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that, and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
It is the ultimate scarce resource, the one planet that we share.
And economics is very interested in scarcity.
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome, it thinks in terms of efficiency.
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use.
It is an efficiency measure.
And probably the easiest way to show you that, is to show you this graph.
Running horizontally along the graph, is "ecological footprint," which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet.
More is bad.
Running vertically upwards, is a measure called "happy life years."
It's about the well-being of nations.
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
Now, there's a huge array of nations around that global average.
To the top right of the graph, are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being, but they're using a lot of planet to get there.
They are the U.S.A., other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually.
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph, are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically, sub-Saharan Africa.
In Hobbesian terms, life is short and brutish there.
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years.
Malaria, HIV/AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world.
But now for the good news!
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles, that are doing better than global average, that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
This is an aspirational graph.
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
They're Latin American.
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to.
Maybe some of you have.
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.
That is longer than in the USA.
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll, the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.
They are the happiest place.
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] Western world -- a quarter of the resources.
What's going on there?
What's happening in Costa Rica?
We can look at some of the data.
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021.
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949.
And they invested in social programs -- health and education.
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world.
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
They have the social connectedness.
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European.
It might be Latin American.
And the challenge, really, is to pull the global average up here.
That's what we need to do.
And if we're going to do that, we need to pull countries from the bottom, and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world, but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
And this is the trend in well-being over that time, a small increase, but this is the trend in ecological footprint.
And so in strict happy-planet methodology, we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to.
And the point really is, is that I think, probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening.
It's actually not very long away.
It's half a human lifetime away.
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050.
This is not the very distant future.
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
That is changing our business.
That is changing the way we create our organizations, we do our government policy and we live our lives.
And the point is, we need to carry on increasing well-being.
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce.
None of us, I think, want human progress to stop.
I think we want it to carry on.
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
They want to hold on to what they've got.
And if we're going to engage them, I think that's what we've got to do.
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that, but the point is we need to turn those curves.
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory, systems engineers, where they create feedback loops, put the right information at the right point of time.
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."
You put a smart meter in your home, and you see how much electricity you're using right now, how much it's costing you, your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
What would that look like for society?
Why is it, on the radio news every evening, I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio -- I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
And why do I hear that?
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday, or American used yesterday?
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions?
That's how you create a collective goal.
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees, which we know is really linked to creativity, which is linked to innovation, and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.
What are these for happiness?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier?
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago, a big program called the Foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome.
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life?
And the point of these is they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness, but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
And the first of these is to connect, is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life.
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy?
Keep building them.
The second one is be active.
The fastest way out of a bad mood: step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
Being active is great for our positive mood.
The third one is take notice.
How aware are you of things going on around the world, the seasons changing, people around you?
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being.
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course.
Older people who keep learning and are curious, they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
It's more curiosity.
It can be learning to cook a new dish, picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.
Keep learning.
And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities, but give.
Our generosity, our altruism, our compassion, are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain.
We feel good if we give.
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people.
You measure their happiness at the end of the day, those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves.
And these five ways, which we put onto these handy postcards, I would say, don't have to cost the earth.
They don't have any carbon content.
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.
And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth.
Now, Martin Luther King, on the eve of his death, gave an incredible speech.
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead, there may be trouble ahead, but I fear no one. I don't care.
I have been to the mountain top, and I have seen the Promised Land."
Now, he was a preacher, but I believe the environmental movement and, in fact, the business community, government, needs to go to the top of the mountain top, and it needs to look out, and it needs to see the Promised Land, or the land of promise, and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want.
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition to get there, and we need to pave that great transition with good things.
Human beings want to be happy.
Pave them with the five ways.
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the Happy Planet Index.
And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want, where happiness does not cost the earth.

<title>Shirin Neshat: Art in exile</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Iranian-born artist Shirin Neshat explores the paradox of being an artist in exile: a voice for her people, but unable to go home. In her work, she explores Iran pre- and post-Islamic Revolution, tracing political and societal change through powerful images of women.</description>
The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist, as an Iranian woman artist, as an Iranian woman artist living in exile.
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.
On the dark side, politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another, is political.
Politics have defined our lives.
If you're living in Iran, you're facing censorship, harassment, arrest, torture -- at times, execution.
If you're living outside like me, you're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family.
Therefore, we don't find the moral, emotional, psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility.
Oddly enough, an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice, the speaker of my people, even if I have, indeed, no access to my own country.
Also, people like myself, we're fighting two battles on different grounds.
We're being critical of the West, the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us, about our women, about our politics, about our religion.
We are there to take pride and insist on respect.
And at the same time, we're fighting another battle.
That is our regime, our government -- our atrocious government, [that] has done every crime in order to stay in power.
Our artists are at risk.
We are in a position of danger.
We pose a threat to the order of the government.
But ironically, this situation has empowered all of us, because we are considered, as artists, central to the cultural, political, social discourse in Iran.
We are there to inspire, to provoke, to mobilize, to bring hope to our people.
We are the reporters of our people, and are communicators to the outside world.
Art is our weapon.
Culture is a form of resistance.
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression.
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics.
From the fact that they are only serving one audience, mainly the Western culture.
But also, I worry about the West, because often in this country, in this Western world that we have, culture risks being a form of entertainment.
Our people depend on our artists, and culture is beyond communication.
My journey as an artist started from a very, very personal place.
I did not start to make social commentary about my country.
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years.
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
While I was absent from Iran, the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture.
I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society.
But instead, I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore.
More so, I became very interested, as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions, I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution -- how, indeed, it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women.
I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting, in the way the women of Iran, historically, seemed to embody the political transformation.
So in a way, by studying a woman, you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life, and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom, the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God, faith, but violence and crime and cruelty.
For me, this became incredibly important.
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place, but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn't know I would discover.
So my art became slightly more critical.
My knife became a little sharper.
And I fell into a life in exile.
I am a nomadic artist.
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.
Now I am making films.
Last year, I finished a film called "Women Without Men."
"Women Without Men" returns to history, but another part of our Iranian history.
It goes to 1953 when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader, Dr. Mossadegh.
The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur.
It's a magical realist novel.
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison.
My obsession with this book, and the reason I made this into a film, is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally, historically in Iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change, freedom and democracy -- while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character, also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions.
I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country.
That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution.
That Iran was once a secular society, and we had democracy, and this democracy was stolen from us by the American government, by the British government.
This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized -- in the way we looked, in the way we played music, in the way we had intellectual life.
And most of all, in the way that we fought for democracy.
These are some of the shots actually from my film.
These are some of the images of the coup.
And we made this film in Casablanca, recreating all the shots.
This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story, but also a feminine story.
Being a visual artist, indeed, I am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics, religion, the question of feminism, and become an important, timeless, universal work of art.
The challenge I have is how to do that.
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
How to move you with your emotions, but also make your mind work.
These are some of the images and the characters of the film.
Now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009, as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film, the cry for democracy and social justice, repeats itself now again in Tehran.
The green movement significantly inspired the world.
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy.
What was most significant for me was, once again, the presence of the women.
They're absolutely inspirational for me.
If in the Islamic Revolution, the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice, now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran -- women who were educated, forward thinking, non-traditional, sexually open, fearless and seriously feminist.
These women and those young men united Iranians across the world, inside and outside.
I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women.
That, under all circumstances, they have pushed the boundary.
They have confronted the authority.
They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way.
And once again, they proved themselves.
I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice, and their voice is giving me my voice.
And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist, even if I have to operate in the West only for now.
Thank you so much.

<title>Wingham Rowan: A new kind of job market</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Plenty of people need jobs with very flexible hours -- but it's difficult for those people to connect with the employers who need them. Wingham Rowan is working on that. He explains how the same technology that powers modern financial markets can help employers book workers for slivers of time.</description>
This is about a hidden corner of the labor market.
It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly, if they're to work at all.
So think, for instance, of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition, or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult, or a parent with complex child care needs.
Their availability for work can be such that it's, "A few hours today.
Maybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."
And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly.
Which is a tragedy because there are employers who can use pools of very flexible local people booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.
Imagine that you run a cafe.
It's mid-morning, the place is filling up.
You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.
If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes to start in an hour's time, you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.
They'd have to be available at very competitive rates.
They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.
In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business, so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.
And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers, it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.
There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people, possibly already once they've been inducted.
At this level of the labor market, what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.
They do exist. Here's how they work.
So in this example, a distribution company has said, we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.
Show us everyone who's available.
It's found 31 workers.
Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.
They're all contactable in time for this booking.
They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.
And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.
And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.
Of course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.
You can select as many of them as you want.
They're from multiple agencies.
It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.
And it's monitoring their reliability.
The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.
They're likely to be more expensive.
In an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people, here's a market research company, and it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.
And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.
And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted are available each hour next week.
And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.
But is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market?
Because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get.
Let's make it personal.
Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid, very little prospect of getting a job -- what economic activity could she theoretically engage in?
Well, she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.
She may be interested in providing local services to her community: babysitting, local deliveries, pet care.
She may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn't need them.
So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.
She might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.
And you're probably thinking -- because you're all very web-aware -- yes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption, so she can go online and do all this.
She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed, she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on.
These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.
And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.
Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years, but only for organizations at the top of the economy.
If you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time, executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.
It analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.
It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.
It's all extremely low overhead.
What have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last 20 years?
Basically classified adverts with a search facility.
So why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading, and what the rest of us have?
A modern market is more than a website; it's a web of interoperable marketplaces, back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes, settlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.
And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning, she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.
In the early days of this modern markets technology, the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes, their relationships, their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.
They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes, and in a lot of cases they got it.
But throughout the economy, there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us.
And those facilities -- I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity, the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time, the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.
These mechanisms, these facilities are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo, they're controlled by the state.
And the policymakers who sit on top of them are, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used to underpin a whole new era of markets.
Like everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.
Suppose we stopped taking that for granted.
Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S., or the leader of any other developed nation, woke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create all the jobs I need in the current climate.
I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.
And for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.
How do I make that happen?"
And I think I can see a few eyes rolling.
Politicians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?
Oh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.
Not necessarily.
There is a precedent for technology-enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful: national lotteries.
Let's take Britain as an example.
Our government didn't design the national lottery, it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.
It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.
This act defines what a national lottery will look like.
It specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.
And it puts some obligations on those operators.
In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses, this was an unqualified success.
But let's suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.
Could we use the same model?
I believe we could.
So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.
Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.
Think of it as a regulated public utility.
So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.
And it's a series of markets for low-level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.
And government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets.
It's about public spending going through these markets to buy public services at the local level.
It's about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land.
It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.
It's about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them.
So, taxi journeys might be one example.
And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators, and the key one is, of course, that the operators pay for everything, including all the interfacing into the public sector.
So imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction.
Imagine that there's a concession period defined of maybe 15 years in which they can take all these benefits and run with them.
And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told, whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal.
So government then exits the frame.
This is now in the hands of the consortium.
Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity and make a percentage on all of it or it's all going to crash and burn, which is tough on their shareholders.
It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.
And there would be no constraints on alternative markets.
So this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums.
But it could be very different, because having access to those state-backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service.
Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going to start making their return.
So we're talking about sectors like home hair care, the hire of toys, farm work, hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door, services for tourists, home care.
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed, because national e-markets will deliver data.
So this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.
And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market.
They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents who wanted a pool of babysitters.
Is it worth their while?
Should they be looking at other sectors?
Should they be moving to another part of the country where there's a shortage of babysitters?
This kind of data can become routine.
And this data can be used by investors.
So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training, an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years.
This is a world of atomized capitalism.
So it's small trades by small people, but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.
Some rough research suggests this could unlock around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the U.K.
Does that sound improbable to you?
That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges 20 years ago.
Do not underestimate the transformative power of truly modern markets.
Thank you.

<title>Martin Seligman: The new era of positive psychology</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Martin Seligman talks about psychology -- as a field of study and as it works one-on-one with each patient and each practitioner. As it moves beyond a focus on disease, what can modern psychology help us to become?</description>
When I was president of the American Psychological Association, they tried to media-train me, and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today, which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them, I'm going to give you the eleventh.
So they came to me -- CNN -- and they said, "Professor Seligman, would you tell us about the state of psychology today?
We'd like to interview you about that." And I said, "Great."
And she said, "But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite."
So I said, "Well, how many words do I get?"
And she said, "Well, one."
And cameras rolled, and she said, "Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
"Good."
"Cut. Cut. That won't do.
We'd really better give you a longer sound bite."
"Well, how many words do I get this time?" "I think, well, you get two.
Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
"Not good."
"Look, Doctor Seligman, we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium.
We'd better give you a real sound bite.
This time you can have three words.
Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
"Not good enough." And that's what I'm going to be talking about.
I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.
And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology, about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.
So, why was psychology good?
Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.
Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did, they'd move away from me.
And because, quite rightly, they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony.
And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.
And what was good about psychology, about the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made, about working in the disease model, about what you mean by psychology, is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors.
And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed, a science of mental illness.
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression, alcoholism -- and measure them with rigor.
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses.
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.
We could look across time at the same people -- people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are, and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.
And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.
And then we were able to test them rigorously, in random assignment, placebo controlled designs, throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry, over the last 60 years, can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.
And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it.
But what was not good, the consequences of that were three things.
The first was moral, that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers, that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.
We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.
We forgot about improving normal lives.
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive. And "genius," "high-talent," became a dirty word.
No one works on that.
And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier, positive interventions.
So that was not good.
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology, which has three aims.
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.
It should be interested in the best things in life.
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living.
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.
And any of you, for free, can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.
You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning, for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities: a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio, how they're defined, how to diagnose them, what builds them and what gets in their way.
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness.
I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people, and I've asked the question, how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?
And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.
And how do they differ from the rest of us?
And it turns out there's one way.
They're not more religious, they're not in better shape, they don't have more money, they're not better looking, they don't have more good events and fewer bad events.
The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social.
They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.
They don't spend time alone.
Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends.
But watch out here. This is merely correlational data, not causal, and it's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I'm going to talk about: happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer.
And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment.
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries, from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy.
And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them, and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies.
That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is can psychology actually make people happier?
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.
The first happy life is the pleasant life.
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it.
The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.
That's what Aristotle was talking about.
And third, the meaningful life.
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space.
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here.
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is heritable, about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.
Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly, indeed.
It's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.
And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.
And this leads to the second life.
And I have to tell you about my friend, Len, to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion, more than building pleasure.
In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30, Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work.
By the time he was 20, he was an options trader.
By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company.
Second, in play -- he's a national champion bridge player.
But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.
And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.
Len is an introvert.
American women said to Len, when he dated them, "You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost."
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.
But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football, and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.
The question is, is Len unhappy? And I want to say not.
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity, I think Len is one of the happiest people I know.
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow.
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning, time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell.
When the first card is played, until 10 days later, the tournament is over, time stops for Len.
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way.
Pleasure has raw feels: you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling.
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow, you can't feel anything.
You're one with the music. Time stops.
You have intense concentration.
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.
And we think there's a recipe for it, and it's knowing what your highest strengths are.
And again, there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are.
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can.
Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.
Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's.
Hated the job.
She's working her way through college.
Her highest strength was social intelligence, so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day.
Now obviously she failed.
But what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible.
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness.
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.
You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption.
So, that's the second path. The first path, positive emotion.
The second path is eudaimonian flow.
And the third path is meaning.
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.
And meaning, in this view, consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives, the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life, people are now hard at work on the question, are there things that lastingly change those lives?
And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it.
It's being done in a rigorous manner.
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.
So we do random assignment, placebo controlled, long-term studies of different interventions.
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect, when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day.
Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day, and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.
Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now, if you would.
Close your eyes.
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction, and who you never properly thanked.
The person has to be alive. OK.
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.
I hope all of you have such a person.
Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why, show up at their door, you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens.
And what happens is when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.
Another example is a strength date, in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test, and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths, and we find this is a strengthener of relationships.
And fun versus philanthropy.
But it's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.
Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and to contrast it.
And what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set.
When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts.
So those are examples of positive interventions.
So, the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.
And this is really what you're about. And that's our target variable.
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get?
So we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?
And our results surprised us, but they were backward of what we thought.
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.
Which is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three.
Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.
And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship, physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity, follow the same relationship?
That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?
Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life?
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.
So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this.
I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much, which was one of the remarkable things.
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way.
We all know that technology, entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes.
We also know that technology, entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery.
And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important.
I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy.
And I never found that. I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero.
But they were empty.
And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life, the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning, are different from the skills of relieving misery.
And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe.
That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion, and that's typically how they've been used.
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -- not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough -- there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.
As Laura Lee told us, design, and, I believe, entertainment and technology, can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.
So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet.
And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough.
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion, meaning, eudaimonia, it will be good enough.
And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaimonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough. Thank you.

<title>AnnMarie Thomas: Hands-on science with squishy circuits</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In a zippy demo at TED U, AnnMarie Thomas shows how two different kinds of homemade play dough can be used to demonstrate electrical properties -- by lighting up LEDs, spinning motors, and turning little kids into circuit designers.</description>
I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.
But you have to have the right tools.
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands.
So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of: Play-Doh.
And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes.
And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough -- pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.
We have two favorite recipes -- one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt.
And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these.
But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.
You see that really salty Play-Doh?
Well, it conducts electricity.
And this is nothing new.
It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years.
But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.
And that sugar dough?
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough.
So what does that mean?
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own.
And so I want to do a little demo for you.
So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in -- it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up.
But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit.
If I push these together, the light turns off.
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.
If I separate them again, I have some light.
Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.
It's like a wall to the electricity.
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light.
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning.
And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids.
I plug in again the power to it.
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.
I can start plugging in lots of lights.
And we can start talking about things like electrical load.
What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor?
It'll dim.
We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done.
You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this.
So this is all in your home kitchen.
We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.
We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.
We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves.
And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.
We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii.
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.
We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should.
Have fun. Thank you.

<title>Billy Graham: On technology and faith</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Speaking at TED in 1998, Rev. Billy Graham marvels at technology's power to improve lives and change the world -- but says the end of evil, suffering and death will come only after the world accepts Christ. A legendary talk from TED's archives.</description>
As a clergyman, you can imagine how out of place I feel.
I feel like a fish out of water, or maybe an owl out of the air.
I was preaching in San Jose some time ago, and my friend Mark Kvamme, who helped introduce me to this conference, brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me, or I with them.
And I was so stimulated.
And had such -- it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science.
I know that we're near the end of this conference, and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion.
Richard can answer that, because he made that decision.
But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia, coming down.
I was to address a conference at a hotel.
And on that elevator a man said, "I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel."
And another man looked in my direction and said, "Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us."
And this man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds, and he said, "My, what an anticlimax!"
I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a -- is an anticlimax, after all these tremendous talks that you've heard, But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago, and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.
His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.
And there was a drunk man on there, and he got up out of his seat two or three times, and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do.
And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by, and everybody was upset with him.
And finally, John Belk said, "Do you know who's sitting here?"
And the man said, "No, who?"
He said, "It's Billy Graham, the preacher."
He said, "You don't say!"
And he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!"
He said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."
And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people.
I know that as you have been peering into the future, and as we've heard some of it here tonight, I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be.
But I won't, because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year, and I know that my time is brief.
I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs, and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here, because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that, and some other problems that I won't talk about.
But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution.
We've had others.
And there's one that I want to talk about.
In one generation, the nation of the people of Israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the Near East.
A man by the name of David came to the throne, and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation.
He was a man of tremendous leadership.
He had the favor of God with him.
He was a brilliant poet, philosopher, writer, soldier -- with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today.
But about two centuries before David, the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron, and, slowly, that skill spread.
But they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it, or to have any.
But David changed all of that, and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel.
And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron, and which archaeologists have found, that in present-day Palestine, there are evidences of that generation.
Now, instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones, Israel now had iron plows, and sickles, and hoes and military weapons.
And in the course of one generation, Israel was completely changed.
The introduction of iron, in some ways, had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation.
And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve.
There were many problems still left.
And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them, and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.
How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention?
The first one that David saw was human evil.
Where does it come from?
How do we solve it?
Over again and again in the Psalms, which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world, David describes the evils of the human race.
And yet he says, "He restores my soul."
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?
On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology, as this conference vividly demonstrates.
We've seen under the sea, three miles down, or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future.
But on the other hand, something is wrong.
Our battleships, our soldiers, are on a frontier now, almost ready to go to war with Iraq.
Now, what causes this?
Why do we have these wars in every generation, and in every part of the world?
And revolutions?
We can't get along with other people, even in our own families.
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can't break.
Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world, bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.
Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle.
I would like to see Oracle take up that, or some other technological geniuses work on this.
How do we change man, so that he doesn't lie and cheat, and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever?
The Bible says the problem is within us, within our hearts and our souls.
Our problem is that we are separated from our Creator, which we call God, and we need to have our souls restored, something only God can do.
Jesus said, "For out of the heart come evil thoughts: murders, sexual immorality, theft, false testimonies, slander."
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man, but he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies, and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out."
Albert Einstein -- I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton, and I met Mr. Einstein.
He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said nobody was qualified to give him one.
But he made this statement.
He said, "It's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man."
And many of you, I'm sure, have thought about that and puzzled over it.
You've seen people take beneficial technological advances, such as the Internet we've heard about tonight, and twist them into something corrupting.
You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems.
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology, horribly used.
The problem is not technology.
The problem is the person or persons using it.
King David said that he knew the depths of his own soul.
He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery.
Yet King David sought God's forgiveness, and said, "You can restore my soul."
You see, the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind.
We are a soul.
And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding.
That's the part of us that yearns for God, or something more than we find in technology.
Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life, and which seeks for something beyond this life.
It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.
I find [that] young people all over the world are searching for something.
They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities, and I have many questions and answer periods, and whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard, or Oxford -- I've spoken at all of those universities.
I'm going to Harvard in about three or four -- no, it's about two months from now -- to give a lecture.
And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there.
And it'll be on these questions: where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?
What's life all about? Why am I here?
Even if you have no religious belief, there are times when you wonder that there's something else.
Thomas Edison also said, "When you see everything that happens in the world of science, and in the working of the universe, you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge."
I remember once, I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner.
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.
And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists, and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well, and I said, "I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.
What shall I talk to her about?"
And he surprised me with the answer.
He said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.
That's what she's really interested in."
I was a little bit surprised, but that evening that's what we talked about, and it was a stimulating conversation.
And afterward, she said, "You know, I'm an atheist, but I know that there's something up there higher than we are."
The second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering.
Writing the oldest book in the world was Job, and he said, "Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward."
Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering.
But I'm -- in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.
I admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years.
My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here.
I haven't given a talk in nearly four months.
And when you speak as much as I do, three or four times a day, you get rusty.
That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes.
Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere, I'm not reading. I never read an address.
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.
I talk ad lib.
But tonight, I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget, which I do sometimes, I've got something I can turn to.
But even here among us, most -- in the most advanced society in the world, we have poverty.
We have families that self-destruct, friends that betray us.
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.
I've never met a person in the world or a worry.
Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question that we haven't answered.
Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God.
He said, "The Lord is my shepherd."
The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death.
Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation.
Most people live as if they're never going to die.
Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality.
We see people on our screens.
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our -- many young people think she's still alive.
They don't know that she's dead.
Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.
The old stars, they come to life.
And they're -- they're just as great on that screen as they were in person.
But death is inevitable.
I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress, last year.
And we were meeting in that room, the statue room.
About 300 of them were there.
And I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room, all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat, or whoever."
I said, "We're all going to die.
And we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us."
And it's often difficult for young people to understand that.
It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.
As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote, he said, there's every activity under heaven.
There's a time to be born, and there's a time to die.
I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people, whom you would know.
I've talked to them.
I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death.
And yet, a few years earlier, death never crossed their mind.
I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor.
She said he never thought of God, never talked about God, didn't believe in God. He was an atheist.
But she said, as he came to die, he sat up on the side of the bed one day, and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.
And he said, for the first time in his life he'd thought about the inevitable, and about God.
Was there a God?
A few years ago, a university student asked me, "What is the greatest surprise in your life?"
And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life.
It passes so fast."
But it does not need to have to be that way.
Wernher von Braun, in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote: "science and religion are not antagonists.
On the contrary, they're sisters."
He put it on a personal basis.
I knew Dr. von Braun very well.
And he said, "Speaking for myself, I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator."
He also said, "In our search to know God, I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.
The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind."
I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France, and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.
And I was invited one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer, who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany, since the war.
And he once -- and he said to me, he said, "Young man." He said, "Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?"
And I said, "Sir, I do."
He said, "So do I."
He said, "When I leave office, I'm going to spend my time writing a book on why Jesus Christ rose again, and why it's so important to believe that."
In one of his plays, Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying, who says to those gathered around his bed, "The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying."
How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?
Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France.
Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization.
He was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics, even as a teenager.
He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory, and a creator of the first model of a computer.
And of course, you are all familiar with the computer language named for him.
Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil, suffering and death.
He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering: that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science, the arts and human enterprise, yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy and have -- and self-hatreds.
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion.
On November 23, 1654, Pascal had a profound religious experience.
He wrote in his journal these words: "I submit myself, absolutely, to Jesus Christ, my redeemer."
A French historian said, two centuries later, "Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ."
Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony, but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven, and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.
He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason.
It was he who penned the well-known words, "The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of."
Equally well known is Pascal's Wager.
Essentially, he said this: "if you bet on God, and open yourself to his love, you lose nothing, even if you're wrong.
But if instead you bet that there is no God, then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come."
For Pascal, scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God.
The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind.
He was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39.
King David lived to be 70, a long time in his era.
Yet he too had to face death, and he wrote these words: "even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me."
This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil, suffering and death.
It can be yours, as well, as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future.
When I was 17 years of age, I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.
I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school.
And there were 20 of them that I had -- that I was responsible for, and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies.
I didn't make good grades in high school.
I didn't make them in college, until something happened in my heart.
One day, I was faced face-to-face with Christ.
He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."
Can you imagine that? "I am the truth.
I'm the embodiment of all truth."
He was a liar.
Or he was insane.
Or he was what he claimed to be.
Which was he?
I had to make that decision.
I couldn't prove it.
I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it.
But by faith I said, I believe him, and he came into my heart and changed my life.
And now I'm ready, when I hear that call, to go into the presence of God.
Thank you, and God bless all of you.
Thank you for the privilege. It was great.
Richard Wurman: You did it.
Thanks.

<title>Patricia Ryan: Don't insist on English!</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Patricia Ryan is a longtime English teacher who asks a provocative question: Is the world's focus on English preventing the spread of great ideas in other languages? In other words: What if Einstein had to pass the TOEFL? It's a passionate defense of translating and sharing ideas.</description>
I know what you're thinking.
You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat.
I get that all the time in Dubai.
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"
"Come to visit the children?
How long are you staying?"
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years.
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.
Now that statistic is quite shocking.
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English.
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
And one fine day, she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary.
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal.
How did those students get all that knowledge?
Of course, from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents.
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations.
But sadly, today, languages are dying at an unprecedented rate.
A language dies every 14 days.
Now, at the same time, English is the undisputed global language.
Could there be a connection?
Well I don't know.
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post.
Actually, not that long ago.
That is a little bit too early.
But nevertheless, I was recruited by the British Council, along with about 25 other teachers.
And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education.
And of course, the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth.
Okay.
Now this is the major change that I've seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today.
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England, it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth.
And why not?
After all, the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S.
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.
But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test.
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius.
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?
Well, I don't think so.
We English teachers reject them all the time.
We put a stop sign, and we stop them in their tracks.
They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English.
Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University?
I don't think so.
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough.
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society.
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.
Okay.
"But," I hear you say, "what about the research?
It's all in English."
So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It feeds the English requirement.
And so it goes on.
I ask you, what happened to translation?
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then.
They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic, into Persian, and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages.
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
Now don't get me wrong; I am not against teaching English, all you English teachers out there.
I love it that we have a global language.
We need one today more than ever.
But I am against using it as a barrier.
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese?
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line?
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English, which is quite arbitrary.
And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English, they didn't have to pass an English test.
Case in point, Einstein.
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic.
But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test.
Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English.
Now it's exploded.
There are lots and lots of tests of English.
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year.
Now you might think, you and me, "Those fees aren't bad, they're okay," but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people.
So immediately, we're rejecting them.
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently: "Education: The Great Divide."
Now I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English.
They want to give their children the best chance in life.
And to do that, they need a Western education.
Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier.
It's a circular thing.
Okay.
Let me tell you a story about two scientists, two English scientists.
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.
They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German.
So bingo, problem solved.
If you can't think a thought, you are stuck.
But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more.
My daughter came to England from Kuwait.
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.
It's an Arabic-medium school.
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.
And she was the best in the class at those subjects.
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language.
When a language dies, we don't know what we lose with that language.
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village, like all the village children, because the kerosene lamp, it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you?
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp.
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home.
When he received his award, he said these lovely words: "The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent."
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know.
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark.
Let us celebrate diversity.
Mind your language.
Use it to spread great ideas.
Thank you very much.

<title>Alex Steffen: The shareable future of cities</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How can cities help save the future? Alex Steffen shows some cool neighborhood-based green projects that expand our access to things we want and need -- while reducing the time we spend in cars.</description>
Climate change is already a heavy topic, and it's getting heavier because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are.
We're understanding, in fact, that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face.
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us, we tend to seek simple answers.
And I think this is what we've done with climate change.
We look at where the emissions are coming from -- they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth, and we say, okay, well the problem is that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning, so therefore, the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.
And while, of course, we do need clean energy, I would put to you that it's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem, we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it.
And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing.
That shouldn't be news to any of us.
However, it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization.
By mid-century, we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people living in cities or within a day's travel of one.
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.
In order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global North live in today, we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.
It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy.
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet, we need to look somewhere else for the solution.
The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think, because all of those cities we're building are opportunities.
Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants.
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing -- I choose to turn this light switch on -- but really, enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.
I won't show you very many graphs today, but if I can just focus on this one for a moment, it really tells us a lot of what we need to know -- which is, quite simply, that if you look, for example, at transportation, a major category of climate emissions, there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air.
And the correlation, of course, is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.
Basically, we substitute, in our lives, access to the things we want.
We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place.
And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.
But when we live in a denser community, suddenly what we find, of course, is that the things we need are close by.
And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place, suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.
And it is possible, of course, to increase the density of the communities around us.
Some places are doing this with new eco districts, developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods, which is nice work if you can get it, but most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact, reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.
So we're talking about things like infill development: really sharp little changes to where we have buildings, where we're developing.
Urban retrofitting: creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there.
Increasingly, we're realizing that we don't even need to densify an entire city.
What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don't drive as much and so on.
And that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.
So you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city.
And we find that when we do that, we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results.
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense and still hold onto their cars, but the reality is that, by and large, what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect, where people simply stop driving as much, and increasingly, more and more people, if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home, give up their cars altogether.
And this is a huge, huge energy savings, because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars.
We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car, all of the parking and freeways and so on.
When you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn't use any of them really, you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as 90 percent.
And people are embracing this.
All around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.
People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood.
And when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see, what you find is, in fact, even more access suffused into spaces.
Some of it's transportation access.
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case, how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transportation.
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.
This is Google Walking Maps.
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway, and it told me to go via Guernsey.
It did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.
But the technologies are getting better, and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.
And as we just heard earlier, of course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.
Things that don't have any wiring in them at all, we're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation.
Part of what we're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption, which is to get a bunch of stuff, is not, in fact, how we really live best in dense environments.
What we're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things.
My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?
Okay. I do too.
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes in its entire lifetime, depending on who you ask.
And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time, use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
Our cities, I would put to you, are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.
And while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities -- such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit -- what we probably will find is that, in fact, turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them, is a far smarter way to go.
And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.
We're finding that people can share the same spaces, do stuff with vacant space.
Buildings are becoming bundles of services.
So we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on -- like heating, cooling etc. -- and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.
So we light our buildings with daylight.
We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.
In fact, when we use all these things, what we've found is that, in some cases, energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.
Which brings on another threshold effect I like to call furnace dumping, which is, quite simply, if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace, you save a whole bunch of money up front.
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives.
Now when we look at being able to slash our product use, slash our transportation use, slash our building energy use, all of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.
And if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities, we need to think a little differently.
This is one way to do it.
This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.
So we have visions like this.
We have visions like this. We have visions like this.
Now all of these are fine projects, but they really have missed an essential point, which is it's not about the leaves above, it's about the systems below.
Do they, for instance, capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use?
Water is energy intensive.
Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure, so that we can take runoff and water that's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees?
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by, for example, connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration?
Do they allow for pollination, pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?
Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth, and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities?
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible, they're being done right now, and that it's a darn good thing.
Because right now, our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said, "by stealing the future, selling it in the present and calling it GDP."
And if we have another eight billion or seven billion, or six billion, even, people, living on a planet where their cities also steal the future, we're going to run out of future really fast.
But if we think differently, I think that, in fact, we can have cities that are not only zero emissions, but have unlimited possibilities as well.
Thank you very much.

<title>Boyd Varty: What I learned from Nelson Mandela</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "In the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us." Boyd Varty, a wildlife activist, shares stories of animals, humans and their interrelatedness, or "ubuntu" -- defined as, "I am, because of you." And he dedicates the talk to South African leader Nelson Mandela, the human embodiment of that same great-hearted, generous spirit.</description>
I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart, and so just before I get going, I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago.
Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom.
And so this talk is going to be for him.
I grew up in wonder.
I grew up amongst those animals.
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.
It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations.
Now for as long as I can remember, my job has been to take people out into nature, and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering.
Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories, and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories, stories about heroes of heart.
Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news, and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place, I also know it to be a place where people, animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world.
When I was nine years old, President Mandela came to stay with my family.
He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration, and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status.
Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye, and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.
But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.
I would take him breakfast in bed, and then, in an old track suit and slippers, he would go for a walk around the garden.
At night, I would sit with my family around the snowy, bunny-eared TV, and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.
He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa, one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.
Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think, to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa: peace, reconciliation, harmony.
Through this act of immense open-heartedness, he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call "ubuntu."
Ubuntu: I am because of you.
Or, people are not people without other people.
It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on.
In fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa, we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others.
Ubuntu is at play right now.
You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am.
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this.
If Mandela was the national and international embodiment, then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man, Solly Mhlongo.
Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.
He would never have a lot of money, but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet.
Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.
Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle, but it makes for über-resourcefulness.
The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks.
Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea, but he could do it.
He then moved across into what we called the habitat team.
These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being.
He fixed roads, he mended wetlands, he did some anti-poaching.
And then one day we were out together, and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked.
And it was an old track, but for fun he turned and he began to follow it, and I tell you, I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.
If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve, you look up in your rearview mirror, you'd see he'd stopped the car 20, 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something.
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said, "Solly, you are pathologically helpful."
When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment, Solly was my tracker.
We worked together as a team.
And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast, and they said to Solly, on the side, they said, "Before we even go out to see lions and leopards, we want to see where you live."
So we took them up to his house, and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife, who was learning English, was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying, "Hello, I love you.
Welcome, I love you."
And there was something so beautifully African about it to me, this small house with a huge heart in it.
Now on the day that Solly saved my life, he was already my hero.
It was a hot day, and we found ourselves down by the river.
Because of the heat, I took my shoes off, and I rolled up my pants, and I walked into the water.
Solly remained on the bank.
The water was clear running over sand, and we turned and we began to make our way upstream.
And a few meters ahead of us, there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank, and its branches were touching the water, and it was shadowy.
And if had been a horror movie, people in the audience would have started saying, "Don't go in there. Don't go in there."
And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.
Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite.
Wham! It hits me by my right leg.
It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch.
It's shaking me violently.
It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you, and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that.
Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.
He turns. He begins to make his way to me.
The croc again continues to shake me.
It goes to bite me a second time.
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream.
As it bites the second time, I kick.
My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.
I pull myself up into the branches, and as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder.
My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description.
The bone is cracked.
The meat is torn up.
I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again.
As I come out of the water, Solly arrives at a deep section, a channel between us.
He knows, he sees the state of my leg, he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile, and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second.
He comes straight into the channel.
He wades in to above his waist.
He gets to me. He grabs me.
I'm still in a vulnerable position.
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.
This is the other thing about Solly, he's freakishly strong.
He turns. He walks me up the bank.
He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.
He wraps it around my leg, picks me up a second time, walks me to a vehicle, and he's able to get me to medical attention.
And I survive.
Now — Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.
And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa.
In a more collective society, we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others.
Danger is shared. Pain is shared.
Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.
Houses are shared. Food is shared.
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share, and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value, his animated, empathetic action in every moment.
Now although the root word is about people, I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.
And then I met this young lady.
Her name was Elvis.
In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance.
She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis.
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route.
When I first saw her, I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.
And yet, for the next five years she returned in the winter months.
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track.
It looked like an inverted bracket, and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow, and then we would come around the corner, and there she would be with her herd.
And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.
And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals.
And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving.
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole.
It was sort of a hollow in the ground.
And I watched as the matriarch drank, and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants, looks like the arm in motion, and she began to make her way up the steep bank.
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.
And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill.
She got visibly -- ears came forward, she had a full go of it and halfway up, her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.
She attempted it a second time, and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.
And on the third attempt, an amazing thing happened.
Halfway up the bank, a young teenage elephant came in behind her, and he propped his trunk underneath her, and he began to shovel her up the bank.
And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant.
The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth, and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground.
And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant.
What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu, and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us.
And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet.
If Africa has a gift to share, it's a gift of a more collective society.
And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea, what I see is the essence of that value being invented here.
Thank you.
Pat Mitchell: So Boyd, we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today, and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.
But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts, because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session.
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.
I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.
He was suffering.
And so of course there's the mixed emotions.
But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about.
And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you."
I mean, that's just incredible humility.
He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.
And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.
You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win.
Anywhere he went, things went well.
But I think that magic will be with us, and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for.
And so that's what I'm going to try and do, and that's what people all over South Africa are trying to do.
PM: And that's what you've done today. BV: Oh, thank you.
PM: Thank you. BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.

<title>Dennis vanEngelsdorp: A plea for bees</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Bees are dying in droves. Why? Leading apiarist Dennis vanEngelsdorp looks at the gentle, misunderstood creature's important place in nature and the mystery behind its alarming disappearance.</description>
What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly, is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right, and then nod to the person on your left.
Now, chances are that over the last winter, if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died.
Now, that's an awful lot of bees.
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.
Now, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.
And most of those losses are because of things we know.
We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon, which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.
And below, you can see all these out yards, or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February, and then they're shipped out to the almonds.
And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months after I was here, described this not as beehives but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.
Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is.
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.
In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year, this flu was caused by a new virus to us, or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it, and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because, of course, there's the implication.
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.
It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with, and the question that keeps us up at night, is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu, and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?
And we don't have the answer to that yet, and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these very strange things that we can't begin to understand.
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.
Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies, beekeepers can replace them very quickly.
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know, the National Guard would be out.
But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony, they can split that colony in two.
And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida, and you can introduce that queen.
And in fact, America was the first country that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact, it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.
If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually, a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course, the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get, you know, your three-pound packages of bees.
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.
So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs, and so they've been able to cover those losses.
So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year, the same number of colonies have existed in the country, at about 2.4 million colonies.
Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts, and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.
And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first, because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.
If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die, to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco backyard pig farmer.
And you get all of these people in the same room, and they're all engaged and they're getting along, and they're all there because of the passion for bees.
Now, there's another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers, the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.
And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious, intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.
And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.
I mean, there may be 100 explanations for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is, but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.
But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here, and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.
No formal education, but very knowledgeable.
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable, he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen from cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening, right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.
We also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.
He's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells.
And he has a history of these trucks, and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.
And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees, and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts, so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.
And you can do that one year in a row, you may be able to do it two years in a row.
But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies, you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried about losing this segment of our industry.
And that's important for many fronts, and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.
You know, they pick up their hives; they move their families once or twice in a year.
And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida, that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.
And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland, and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.
And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.
And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves.
They all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience, and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time, because that's quite essential American experience.
And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know, father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.
And they're not people who like to ask for help, although they are the most helpful people ever.
If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul, everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives to help him replace those lost colonies.
And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think, historic and exciting community to be involved with.
Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.
And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.
I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener, and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.
But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.
Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning -- a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola, I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know, jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee -- and had we taken out all those ingredients, -- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola -- if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated, we wouldn't have much on our plate.
So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve, but clearly our diet would be diminished.
It's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life, and for flowers bees are the messengers of love.
And that's a really great expression, because really, bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know -- they get paid for their services.
They get paid by pollen and nectar, to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.
And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't -- the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.
So in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples of one variety, and then you have another apple tree that's a different type of pollen.
And bees are very faithful.
When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower, they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.
And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.
They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.
However, honeybees are a minority.
Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced with the colonialists.
And there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined.
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years, and very intensely in the last three years.
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.
Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right, but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.
We have bumblebees on the top.
And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social, because only the queen is, over winter.
We also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.
They're like tiny little flies and they fly around.
And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites, which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering -- what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering -- Audience: Bee?
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.
What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees, they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch, and they collect pollen and make it into a ball, and they lay an egg on it.
Well, these bees hang out at that hole, and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg, and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.
And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees, you know that your environment is healthy, because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.
And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast, go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.
And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble, but we don't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community.
And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.
There are other animals that pollinate, like bats, and bats are in trouble too.
And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man, because there's no money to research the bat problems.
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.
If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it, and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years.
And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.
But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD: Nature Deficit Disorder.
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is, we forgot our connection with nature.
And I think if we reconnect to nature, we'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems.
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.
And I think we have lost our connection, and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.
It used to be, two, three hundred years ago, that a lawn was a symbol of prestige, and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.
Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.
And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.
And so we need to rethink this idea.
In fact, you know, the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea; it wouldn't be a bad idea.
I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here, because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants, or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that -- and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine, this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances.
And this is a companion, and this is a relationship that never dries up.
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.
And I encourage you to look at that.
Now, not all of us have meadows, or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course, grow a meadow in a pot.
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.
So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot, but a pot in a meadow.
But you can also have this great community of city or building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live -- This is in Paris where these beekeepers live.
And everyone should open a beehive, because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder, I think this is a great way of doing it.
Get a beehive and grow a meadow, and watch that life come back into your life.
And so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this, we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future -- includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.
And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.
And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day.
So thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much.

<title>Steven Johnson: The Web as a city</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Outside.in's Steven Johnson says the Web is like a city: built by many people, completely controlled by no one, intricately interconnected and yet functioning as many independent parts. While disaster strikes in one place, elsewhere, life goes on.</description>
I want to take you back basically to my hometown, and to a picture of my hometown of the week that "Emergence" came out.
And it's a picture we've seen several times.
Basically, "Emergence" was published on 9/11.
I live right there in the West Village, so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.
We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours -- we hadn't taken it from somebody else.
And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building, was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written.
Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density, of largely urban density, of connecting people and putting them together in one place, and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together.
And it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling, those towers burning and falling -- that in fact, one of the lessons here was that density kills.
And that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being, probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings 110 stories above the ground.
If they hadn't been crowded -- you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers, and you can see that very powerfully.
And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density -- I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.
And then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit, and you could sense that the air was not healthy.
And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village where we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know, a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond, which was located about 20 blocks away, north.
And so I went out.
And obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell -- -- so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.
And I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me as I was walking north to buy this air filter, which was that the streets were completely alive with people.
There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day, as it was for about a week after, and the West Village had never seemed more lively.
I walked up along Hudson Street -- where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in "Emergence" -- past the White Horse Tavern, that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death, and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.
And all the people who lived in the neighborhood, who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood, were all out there -- had them all open.
People were out.
There were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways.
And it was a beautiful urban day, and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.
The city was there.
All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating -- they were all on display there on those streets.
And I thought, well, this is the power of a city.
I mean, the power of the city -- we talked about cities as being centralized in space, but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function.
They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail.
If they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero.
I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there, was destroyed by the attacks, and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives.
But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later, the city had never looked more alive.
If you'd gone into the minds of the people, well, you would have seen a lot of trauma, and you would have seen a lot of heartache, and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.
But the system itself of this city was thriving.
So I took heart in seeing that.
So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well, and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now.
The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you've talked about emergent behavior, when you've talked about collective intelligence, the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask, who builds a neighborhood?
Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?
Well, there are some kind of executive decisions, but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody.
Everybody contributes a little bit.
No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood.
Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive post-9/11 in my neighborhood?
Well, it was the whole city.
The whole system kind of working on it, and everybody contributing a small little part.
And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways -- most of which weren't around, actually, except in very experimental things, when I was writing "Emergence" and when the book came out.
So it's been a very optimistic time, I think, and I want to just talk about a few of those things.
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now.
And the old one looked like this.
This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.
It's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and "my hometown" -- those are his links.
But nothing really says this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real, the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than "Click here for a picture of my dog."
That is -- you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link.
And, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense -- to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday -- that was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web: that you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it, and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship.
There's one person putting up the link, and there's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not.
The new model is much more like this, and we've already seen a couple of references to this.
This is what happens when you search "Steven Johnson" on Google.
About two months ago, I had the great breakthrough -- one of my great, kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for "Steven Johnson."
There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson who has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say.
And, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this, but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.
It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.
Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers.
So there's this collective decision-making that's going on.
This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web, and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.
Now, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative -- but there are some new twists on this.
There's this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati -- that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these.
And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.
He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking.
And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs, and so you have kind of an authority -- a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.
And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually, you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?
And you can get a list.
This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.
You can also rank it by the latest posts.
So when I was talking in "Emergence," I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.
And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things.
Well, something like Technorati is supplying that.
Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger, where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web -- there's nothing artificial.
He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there, if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.
And he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus."
And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.
I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right-hand side of my page, and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.
That little list there would change.
I wouldn't really be directly in control of it.
So it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense, wrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.
Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.
And there are all these interesting tools.
Google does the Google Zeitgeist, which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in, and they publish it with lots of fun graphs.
And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google, so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.
There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist, which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.
The Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.
Well, you know, we should expect to see that.
That's not necessarily something we didn't know already.
So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain, that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream -- the question is, are you finding out something new?
And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically, you take an abstract term, and you search Google for that term, and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.
So basically, the number of pages that mention this term, that also mention this page, the percentage of those pages is that person's Google Share of that term.
So you can do kind of interesting contests.
Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.
So Richard Saul Wurman has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.
But the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.
And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.
I had no idea.
No, that's not true.
I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish.
I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.
So right here -- now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages, so this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.
Right below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.
So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.
So Gary Bauer is not too far behind -- has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.
And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So -- you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.
And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel, I think, right there.
Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that, I think it would be good next year.
Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing, but this analysis some of you may have seen.
It just came out. This is bursty words, looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.
So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere, so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off, that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.
So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s -- slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.
That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.
They're talking about slavery in 1860.
1935 -- relief, depression, recovery banks.
And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious.
1985, right at the center of the Reagan years -- that's, we're, there's, we've, it's.
Now, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that "emancipation" and "depression" and "recovery" all have a lot of syllables.
So you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those.
But seriously, actually, what you can see there, in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise, is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic -- contracting all those verbs.
You know, 20 years before it was still, "Ask not what you can do," but with Reagan, it's, "that's where, there's Nancy and I," that kind of language.
And so something we kind of knew, but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing.
I'll go very quickly.
The question now -- and this is the really interesting question -- is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge.
And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.
Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago, and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs.
It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs, and a long tail of blogs with very few links.
So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.
Now this is a very interesting thing.
It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man, one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.
And so the question is, "Why is this happening?"
It's not being imposed by fiat from above.
It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now.
Now, what's great about it is that people are working on -- within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.
And basically, the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage.
if you're the first site there, everybody links to you.
If you're the second site there, most people link to you.
And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links, and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future, and then you get this kind of shape.
And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on, literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece -- was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers.
And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links, that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.
So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.
So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system.
And it creates a kind of planned emergence.
You're not totally in control, but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices.
So the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note -- is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not.
So the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation.
I hope it continues here.
Thanks a lot.

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this passionate talk, Eve Ensler declares that there is a girl cell in us all -- a cell that we have all been taught to suppress. She tells heartfelt stories of girls around the world who have overcome shocking adversity and violence to reveal the astonishing strength of being a girl.</description>
Namaste. Good morning.
I'm very happy to be here in India.
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues," traveling the world, essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women.
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell, or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
And I want to call it the girl cell.
And it's in men as well as in women.
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race.
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell, the oppression of these cells, the reinterpretation of these cells, the undermining of these cells, getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing, eradicating, destroying, reducing these cells, basically began the process of killing off the girl cell, which was, by the way, patriarchy.
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us.
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion, and it's empathy, and it's passion itself, and it's vulnerability, and it's openness, and it's intensity, and it's association, and it's relationship, and it is intuitive.
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom, and that vulnerability is our greatest strength, and that emotions have inherent logic, which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be, that compassion clouds your thinking, that vulnerability is weakness, that emotions are not to be trusted, and you're not supposed to take things personally, which is one of my favorites.
I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl.
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.
To be a man means not to be a girl.
To be a woman means not to be a girl.
To be strong means not to be a girl.
To be a leader means not to be a girl.
I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that.
And I'd also like to say that the irony of course, is that denying girl, suppressing girl, suppressing emotion, refusing feeling has lead thus here.
Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence, the most horrific poverty, genocide, mass rapes, the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.
And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl-ship, we do not feel what is going on.
So, we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening.
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo.
For me, it was the turning point of my life.
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world, a lot of violence.
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.
But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul.
I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital, with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.
In the Congo, for those of you who don't know, there has been a war raging for the last 12 years, a war that has killed nearly six million people.
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there.
When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.
Their stories were so horrific, and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence, that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.
And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering, listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated, who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes, literally, inside them where their pee and poop came out of them.
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled, and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically, all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.
My mind was so shattered.
But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened.
That shattering, that opening of my girl cell, that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous, and braver, and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life.
I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth, and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.
I remember, for example, when my father, who was very, very violent, used to beat me.
And he would actually say, while he was beating me, "Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing.
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.
And I think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell.
I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet: to be tough, to be hardened, to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.
I actually realized once in Kosovo, when I watched a man break down, that bullets are actually hardened tears, that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion, and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful and violent.
And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure, to pretend they know things when they don't know things, or why would we be where we are?
To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.
And I will tell you a very funny story.
On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.
And all these men, literally at least 10 men, were in their little seats watching chick flicks.
And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."
I've traveled, as I said, to many, many countries, and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world.
And we heard from Sunitha yesterday, and Kavita about what we do to girls.
But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns, who are literally being treated like ashtrays.
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles.
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.
I've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate, or we make them feel bad about being too smart.
We silence them. We make them feel guilty for being smart. We get them to behave, to tone it down, not to be too intense.
We sell them, we kill them as embryos, we enslave them, we rape them.
We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities.
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet.
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.
But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24, they are they key, really, in the developing world, as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be, including lack of access to healthcare, education, healthy foods, labor force participation.
The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings, which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.
The state of girls, the condition of girls, will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world -- determine whether the species survives.
And what I want to suggest is that, having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called "I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World," I've been talking to girls for five years, and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb "to please."
Girls are trained to please.
I want to change the verb.
I want us all to change the verb.
I want the verb to be "educate," or "activate," or "engage," or "confront," or "defy," or "create."
If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them.
And I have to now share a few stories of girls I've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl, who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them.
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands, for example, who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself.
There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tattooed on the right side of her face.
There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill, who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.
And this girl, when she was 17 years old, wore a burqa in Afghanistan, and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women, underneath her burqa, with a video.
And that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.
I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say, "End the occupation."
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank.
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.
And she was holding her baby.
And I asked her if she loved her baby.
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said, "Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?
It's my baby and it's full of love."
The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.
Dorcas is 15 years old, and she was trained in self-defense.
A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men.
They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.
And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples, she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car.
In Kenya, in August, I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls, a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl, she was female genitally mutilated.
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet, that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls.
So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like, and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her, and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."
So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.
And it was a house where girls could run away, they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut, they could go to school.
And in the years that Agnes has had the house, she has changed the situation there.
She has literally become deputy mayor.
She's changed the rules.
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.
When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya.
So cows are dying, and cows are the most valued possession.
And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows.
And she knew that meant she would be cut.
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.
So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house, Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days, two days through Masai land.
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.
She imagined her father killing her on one hand, and Mama Agnes greeting her, with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.
And when she got to the house she was greeted.
Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her, and Agnes supported her for the year.
She went to school and she found her voice, and she found her identity, and she found her heart.
Then, her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation, after a year.
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.
In that hut, we walked in, and her father and his four wives were sitting there, and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled, and her primary mother, who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders.
When her father saw her and saw who she had become, in her full girl self, he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.
He said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.
We will not cut you.
And I give you my word, here and now, that we will not cut your sisters either."
And what she said to him was, "You were willing to sell me for four cows, and a calf and some blankets.
But I promise you, now that I will be educated I will always take care of you, and I will come back and I will build you a house.
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."
For me, that is the power of girls.
And that is the power of transformation.
I want to close today with a new piece from my book.
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday, the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
But I really want to do it for each and every person here, to value the girl in us, to value the part that cries, to value the part that's emotional, to value the part that's vulnerable, to understand that's where the future lies.
This is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.
I was asking girls if they like being a girl, and all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."
And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.
I'm an emotional creature!"
This is for her: I love being a girl.
I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before.
I am an emotional creature.
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard-pressed ideas.
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.
Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off, even though she appears to give you what you want.
I know when a storm is coming.
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.
I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.
I am an emotional creature.
I love that I do not take things lightly.
Everything is intense to me, the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up, the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.
I am an emotional creature.
I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.
Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing, or it's only because I'm a girl.
These feelings make me better.
They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.
I am an emotional creature.
There is a particular way of knowing.
It's like the older women somehow forgot.
I rejoice that it's still in my body.
Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.
I know my father isn't coming back, and that no one's prepared for the fire.
I know that lipstick means more than show, and boys are super insecure, and so-called terrorists are made, not born.
I know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability.
And you know what? Sometimes it should.
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing, what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open.
Don't tell me not to cry, to calm it down, not to be so extreme, to be reasonable.
I am an emotional creature.
It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.
I am an emotional creature.
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?
I am your remaining memory.
I can take you back.
Nothing's been diluted.
Nothing's leaked out.
I love, hear me, I love that I can feel the feelings inside you, even if they stop my life, even if they break my heart, even if they take me off track, they make me responsible.
I am an emotional, I am an emotional, incondotional, devotional creature.
And I love, hear me, I love, love, love being a girl.
Can you say it with me?
I love, I love, love, love being a girl!
Thank you very much.

<title>Rives: The 4 a.m. mystery</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Poet Rives does 8 minutes of lyrical origami, folding history into a series of coincidences surrounding that most surreal of hours, 4 o'clock in the morning.</description>
This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.
The punch line?
"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Labrador."
This is a recent cover of New York Magazine.
Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment, births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.
And this is a song medley I put together -- Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand?
It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.
A time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police, like in this classic scene from "The Godfather."
Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.
It is four in the morning."
A time for even grimmer stuff than that, like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's "The House of the Spirits."
After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered, the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.
They worked until four o'clock in the morning.
A time for even grimmer stuff than that, like in last April's New Yorker magazine.
This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine, and Mohamed Atta's last day began."
For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- across a lot of different media from a lot of big names.
And it made me suspicious.
I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really, aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it, right?
Could it be there is something more going on here?
Something deliberate, something secret, and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?
I say this guy -- Alberto Giacometti, shown here with some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.
He did it with this famous piece from the New York Museum of Modern Art.
Its title -- "The Palace at Four in the Morning -- 1932.
Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find.
I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.
I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.
No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if you've got them.
It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google search for four in the morning.
Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.
The top 10 results yield you four hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning," three hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning," one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, "Four in the Morning."
But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame, a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking?
Well, let's start with Faron Young -- who was born incidentally in 1932.
In 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth -- which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.
But he didn't die on Dench's birthday.
He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 -- which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?
She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.
On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning, Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee, Ms. Four in the Morning -- or one of them anyway -- Wislawa Szymborska was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.
100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.
Coincidence? No, it's creepy.
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric.
That's like me telling you, "Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901, which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"
No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm, but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels.
In fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.
Video: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room -- You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night, your guy will fry them up?
Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.
Now do you need towels, laundry, maids?
HS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- let me see if I got this straight.
It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.
There's a rumble in my stomach.
Marge Simpson: Homer, please.
Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.
When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock, but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400 on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.
And no, I don't know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously I know a coded message when I see one.
I said, I know a coded message when I see one.
And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life" from the bookstore here at TED.
Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.
Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.
And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket?
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs?
This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along: "Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied with the inaugural address.
My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."
Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.
And then -- three paragraphs later we get this little beauty: "We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."
Well, how could it have?
By his own writing, this man was either asleep, at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase.
What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton?
We might not ever know.
And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions.
It could get awkward, right?
I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.
But if he were here -- he might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography, that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey -- a journey that saw him go on to become the first Democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades.
In generations.
The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election, way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 -- the year Alberto Giacometti made "The Palace at Four in the Morning."
The year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed, first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.

<title>George Dyson: The birth of the computer</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Historian George Dyson tells stories from the birth of the modern computer -- from its 17th-century origins to the hilarious notebooks of some early computer engineers.</description>
Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion, which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked, but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.
So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.
This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.
This was a perfect introduction.
And it's a story that did work. It did happen, and the machines are all around us.
And it was a technology that was inevitable.
If the people I'm going to tell you the story about, if they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.
So, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.
This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.
It's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things, including changing biology.
I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity, which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED: it brought a whole lot of very smart people together.
And three of the smartest people were Stan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.
And it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb, he was working on something much more important than bombs: he's thinking about computers.
So, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.
He built this machine, and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works, with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.
The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651, explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing, and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic, you can do it all with arithmetic.
He said you needed addition and subtraction.
Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 -- showed that you didn't even need subtraction.
You could do the whole thing with addition.
Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution.
And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.
He talked about doing it with marbles, having gates and what we now call shift registers, where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.
And that's what all these machines are doing, except, instead of doing it with marbles, they're doing it with electrons.
And then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945, when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.
And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine.
So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet -- and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing, which also goes back to Turing, who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless, little, finite state machine, just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.
The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.
Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people, giving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.
Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will, but capable of only two ideas.
And that's really the simplest computer.
It's basically why you need the qubit, because it only has two ideas.
And you put lots of those together, you get the essentials of the modern computer: the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory, the recording medium, the input and the output.
But, there's one catch. This is the fatal -- you know, we saw it in starting these programs up.
The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.
So, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work.
If you look at the origins of this, the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.
But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about, the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there, really should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history, and give some of these guys more credit than they've had.
Such a computer would open up universes, which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.
So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.
The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.
RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time, decided not to go into computers.
But the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.
RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know, televisions are the future, not computers.
The essentials were all there -- all the things that make these machines run.
Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.
When RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton, where Freeman works at the Institute.
That's where I grew up as a kid.
That's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before, so we both go back to the birth of this thing.
That's Freeman, a long time ago, and that was me.
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern, who wrote the "Theory of Games."
All these forces came together there, in Princeton.
Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.
And Julian Bigelow, who took Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics, how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this, and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.
These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.
They didn't fit in at the Institute.
This is a letter from the director, concerned about -- "especially unfair on the matter of sugar."
You can read the text.
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time.
These were not theoretical physicists.
They were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.
And we take it for granted now, that each of these machines has billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.
They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.
They actually used 6J6, the common radio tube, because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.
And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.
Reports were issued, so that this machine was cloned at 15 other places around the world.
And it really was. It was the original microprocessor.
All the computers now are copies of that machine.
The memory was in cathode ray tubes -- a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube -- very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.
So, there's 40 of these tubes, like a V-40 engine running the memory.
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first.
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.
This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.
Then they switched to a magnetic drum.
This is modifying IBM equipment, which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.
And this is the beginning of computer graphics.
The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide, that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954.
So, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud, doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components.
Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.
And that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.
"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."
This includes a large amount of human error.
So they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?
What's code, what's hardware?
That's an engineer gazing at tube number 36, trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.
So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running, let alone having, you know, software problems.
"No use, went home."
"Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?"
So, already, they're complaining about the manuals: "before closing down in disgust ... " "The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs."
Burning lots of midnight oil.
"MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine, Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory."
"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?"
"Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem.
"Found trouble in code, I hope."
"Code error, machine not guilty."
"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing."
"And the dawn came." So they ran all night.
Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.
"Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night."
"Master control off. The hell with it. Way off."
"Something's wrong with the air conditioner -- smell of burning V-belts in the air."
"A short -- do not turn the machine on."
"IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof."
So they really were working under tough conditions.
Here, "A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse."
"Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953."
There's an inside joke someone has penciled in: "Here lies Marston Mouse."
If you're a mathematician, you get that, because Marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there.
"Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles."
That's two thousand cycles per second -- "yes, I'm chicken" -- so two kilocycles was slow speed.
The high speed was 16 kilocycles.
I don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz, that's slow speed.
"I have now duplicated both results.
How will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?
This now is the third different output.
I know when I'm licked."
"We've duplicated errors before."
"Machine run, fine. Code isn't."
"Only happens when the machine is running."
And sometimes things are okay.
"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running."
"Parting thought: when there's bigger and better errors, we'll have them."
So, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.
They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook, late one night, finally drew a bomb.
So, that was the result. It was Mike, the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.
That was designed on that machine, in the woods behind the Institute.
So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems.
Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life, trying to see if, in this artificial universe -- he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.
He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.
Began -- his universe started March 3, '53.
So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.
And he saw everything in terms of -- he could read the binary code straight off the machine.
He had a wonderful rapport.
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.
Even errors were duplicated.
"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."
So he designed this universe, and ran it.
When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.
He would run that thing all night long, running these things, if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram, who reinvented this stuff.
And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.
It was published in the literature.
"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"
So, he decided to give it a try, to start this artificial biology going in the machines.
And he found all these, sort of -- it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe, and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world, in biology.
This is some of the generations of his universe.
But they're just going to stay numbers; they're not going to become organisms.
They have to have something.
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.
They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that, started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with -- playing chess with other machines and so on.
And they did start to evolve.
And he went around the country after that.
Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it, and saw exactly what's happening now.
That the programs, instead of being turned off -- when you quit the program, you'd keep running and, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing, running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines, he envisioned all that happening.
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.
It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence, but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence.
And he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike, or a new kind of life.
It just was another version of the same thing happening.
And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago.
And could you do it again now?
So, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold, the archivist came up one day, saying, "I think we found another box that had been thrown out."
And it was his universe on punch cards.
So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there -- sort of suspended animation.
That's the instructions for running -- this is actually the source code for one of those universes, with a note from the engineers saying they're having some problems.
"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet."
And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.
What's the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive?
These cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.
And the question is, should we run them or not?
You know, could we get them running?
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?
These machines would think they -- these organisms, if they came back to life now -- whether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.
My laptop is 10 thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.
He was thinking far ahead, to how this would really grow into a new kind of life.
And that's what's happening!
When Juan Enriquez told us about these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth, of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab, that's what Barricelli imagined: that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code -- it already is coding from nucleic acids.
We've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA.
And real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins, and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.
This was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes on self-reproducing machines, what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started to where they begin to reproduce.
It took really three people: Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing; Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines -- that now, last count, four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours; and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago -- this is John Markoff's obituary for him -- he was the important missing link, the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.
And all our computers have, inside them, the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day, sort of on pencil and paper.
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.
And he explained, in a very generous way, the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project, and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions, no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.
That's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down, July 1958.
And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off.
And that's the end.
Thank you very much.

<title>Don Norman: 3 ways good design makes you happy</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this talk from 2003, design critic Don Norman turns his incisive eye toward beauty, fun, pleasure and emotion, as he looks at design that makes people happy. He names the three emotional cues that a well-designed product must hit to succeed.</description>
The new me is beauty.
Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK, but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable but it would be ugly."
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ...
This is neat.
Thank you for setting up my display.
I mean, it's just wonderful.
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for, but I want it.
And that's my new life.
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about, and "pretty," and "emotions."
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."
The acid will ruin the gold plating.
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well.
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
It's a delight to use.
And so it's got everything, right?
It's beautiful and it's functional.
And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
And those are the three components.
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it, and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it.
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table, the ripples spread out and the fish run away.
But of course, then the ball hits the other side, the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.
Is that a good way to play ping-pong?
No. But is it fun?
Yeah! Yeah.
Or look at Google.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results.
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.
This is one through 20. Next," they just give you as many o's as there are pages.
It's really simple and subtle.
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why.
And it's just clever.
And of course, what's especially good is, if you type "design and emotion," the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.
Now, the weird thing is Google lies, because if I type "design and emotion," it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
So, OK.
So I type "design emotion" and my website wasn't first again.
It was third.
Oh well, different story.
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile.
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
Buy it anyway.
It's so much fun to drive."
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
It's round, it's neat.
The controls work wonderfully.
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better, and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ...
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking, I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.
No problem.
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air -- and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
It actually affects the way the brain works.
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
That's what fear and anxiety does; it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing -- to focus, not be distracted.
And I couldn't force myself across that.
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.
But it really changes the way you think.
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen, did this wonderful experiment.
She brought students in to solve problems.
So, she'd bring people into the room, and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here.
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff.
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
Would you tie those two strings together?"
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string.
Still can't reach it.
And, basically, none of them could solve it.
You bring in a second group of people, and you say, "Oh, before we start, I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.
Would you like the box of candy?"
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy -- not very happy, but a little bit of happy.
And guess what -- they solved the problem.
And it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you makes you depth-first.
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes, which makes you a breadth-first problem solver: you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
That's what brainstorming is about, right?
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games, and we say, "No criticism," and you get all these weird, neat ideas.
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?
You've got be anxious.
The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.
You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."
No big deal.
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants, because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed.
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds, we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces; we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.
So that's the visceral level.
In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways, like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
Or the 1963 Jaguar: It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time, but the owners love it.
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
A water bottle: You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
It's all about the visceral experience.
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Almost everything we do is subconscious.
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
Most of what we do is subconscious.
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious, controlled by the behavioral side.
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control, which includes usability, understanding -- but also the feel and heft.
That's why the Global knives are so neat.
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp, that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.
Or the sensual feeling.
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower, and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water, by the way, because it recirculates the same dirty water.
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back, and you put tea in, and then you fill it with water.
The water then seeps over the tea.
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
And when it's finished, you put it vertically, and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out.
On top of that, it communicates, which is what emotion does.
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
It's being safe in the world.
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good, bad, safe, dangerous, and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting, subconsciously, except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
Well, this has emotions if you like, because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles.
It looks over what's going on.
It's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.
Here's a great reflective product.
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars, but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."
It's about attention. It's about their image, not about the car.
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car.
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
And you'll buy it to protect the environment, even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected.
But that's reflective design as well.
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people -- "Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."
As opposed to this one, which is a pure behavioral watch, which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
But it's ugly.
This is a clear Don Norman watch.
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other, the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.
So, it's pitting one against the other.
The other neat thing ...
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker, and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.
And this is his chair with claw, and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.
And that's what's nice about emotion.
So that's the new me.
I'm only saying positive things from now on.

<title>Renny Gleeson: Our antisocial phone tricks</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this funny 3-minute talk, social strategist Renny Gleeson breaks down our always-on social world -- where the experience we're having right now is less interesting than what we'll tweet about it later.</description>
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things: one, the rise of a culture of availability; and two, a request.
So we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation, globally, across all social strata.
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices, an expectation of availability.
And, with that, comes the third point, which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability.
And the problem is, we're still working through, from a societal standpoint, how we allow people to be available.
There's a significant delta, in fact, between what we're willing to accept.
Apologies to Hans Rosling -- he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie -- but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint.
So we've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up.
This first one's called "the lean."
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken," you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away, and then quickly checking the device.
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.
"The stretch."
OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you, I'm going to check my device."
But the guy, here, on the right, he's doing the stretch.
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop.
Or, my favorite, the "Love you; mean it."
Nothing says "I love you" like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about."
Or, this one, coming to us from India.
You can find this on YouTube, the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging.
Or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!"
That is actually the device.
What this is doing is, we find a -- a direct collision -- we find a direct collision between availability -- and what's possible through availability -- and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually -- the need to create shared narratives.
We're very good at creating personal narratives, but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.
And when you're standing with someone, and you're on your mobile device, effectively what you're saying to them is, "You are not as important as, literally, almost anything that could come to me through this device."
Look around you.
There might be somebody on one right now, participating in multi-dimensional engagement.
Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later.
This one I love.
This poor kid, clearly a prop -- don't get me wrong, a willing prop -- but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks.
This is the sound of one hand clapping.
So, as we lose the context of our identity, it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative, becomes the context in which we live.
The stories that we tell -- what we push out -- becomes who we are.
People aren't simply projecting identity, they're creating it.
We are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience, which will create the new world.
And so my request is, please, let's make technologies that make people more human, and not less.
Thank you.

<title>Keith Chen: Could your language affect your ability to save money?</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What can economists learn from linguists? Behavioral economist Keith Chen introduces a fascinating pattern from his research: that languages without a concept for the future -- "It rain tomorrow," instead of "It will rain tomorrow" -- correlate strongly with high savings rates.</description>
The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics, dating back to at least before Adam Smith.
And that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior?
Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question, and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this.
What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save.
Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language, and then I'll draw that connection.
Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD, or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
OECD countries, by and large, you should think about these as the richest, most industrialized countries in the world.
And by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitment to democracy, open markets and free trade.
Despite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior.
So all the way over on the left of this graph, what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year, and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.
Holding down the right flank of the OECD, all the way on the other side, is Greece.
And what you can see is that over the last 25 years, Greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.
It should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line.
Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates, how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences?
Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.
Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now.
And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors.
Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese.
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States.
And something I realized quite early on was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and -- in fact, more fundamentally than that -- ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways.
Now, how might that be? Let me give you an example.
Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.
You understood exactly what I just said in English.
If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though, I wouldn't have that luxury.
I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information.
What my language would have forced me to do, instead of just telling you, "This is my uncle," is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information.
My language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side, whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth, and if this man was my father's brother, whether he was older than or younger than my father.
All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.
And in fact, if I want to speak correctly, Chinese forces me to constantly think about it.
Now, that fascinated me endlessly as a child, but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time.
So for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently if I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday," current rain, "It is raining now," or future rain, "It will rain tomorrow."
Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.
Why? Because I have to consider that and I have to modify what I'm saying to say, "It will rain," or "It's going to rain."
It's simply not permissible in English to say, "It rain tomorrow."
In contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese.
A Chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears.
They can say, "Yesterday it rain," "Now it rain," "Tomorrow it rain."
In some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.
Is this difference in languages only between very, very distantly related languages, like English and Chinese?
Actually, no.
So many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language.
What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.
It is the only Germanic language that requires this.
For example, most other Germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying, "Morgen regnet es," quite literally to an English ear, "It rain tomorrow."
This led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis.
Could how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time, affect your propensity to behave across time?
You speak English, a futured language.
And what that means is that every time you discuss the future, or any kind of a future event, grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different.
Now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.
If that's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present, that's going to make it harder to save.
If, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language, the present and the future, you speak about them identically.
If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically, that's going to make it easier to save.
Now this is a fanciful theory.
I'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories.
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory?
Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature.
And interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world.
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe.
Interestingly enough, when you start to crank the data, these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers.
Just to give you a hint of that, let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about.
What you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.
What is the average difference here?
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year.
Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.
Now while these findings are suggestive, countries can be different in so many different ways that it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.
What I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year, which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists, and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences, hoping to get this relationship to break.
And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.
Let me show you how far you can do that.
One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.
So for example, there is the Survey of Health, [Aging] and Retirement in Europe.
From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families are extremely patient with survey takers.
So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.
"Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?
Do you happen to know how much your house is worth? Do you mind telling me?
Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long?
If you do, would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway?
Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device so I can measure your grip strength?
How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity?"
The survey takes over a day.
Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example, which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status of families living in, for example, rural Nigeria.
Combine that with a world value survey, which measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.
Take all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.
What you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages.
And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure, and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels.
What are the characteristics we can control for?
Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence, the demographics -- what sex, their age -- their income level within their own country, their educational achievement, a lot about their family structure.
It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe.
And most granularly, I break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world -- so an extreme level of granularity.
There are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.
Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families.
It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions, but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French; or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria, one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.
Now even after all of this granular level of control, do futureless language speakers seem to save more?
Yes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control, are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.
Does this have cumulative effects?
Yes, by the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income, are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings.
Can we push this data even further?
Yes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.
Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings?
Well, think about smoking, for example.
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings.
If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure, smoking is just the opposite.
It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.
What we should expect then is the opposite effect.
And that's exactly what we find.
Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families, and they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire, and they're going to report being 21 percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.
I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find.
It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn't present.
My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.
Ultimately, the goal, once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making, we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future.
Thank you very much.

<title>Elizabeth Murchison: Fighting a contagious cancer</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What is killing the Tasmanian devil? A virulent cancer is infecting them by the thousands -- and unlike most cancers, it's contagious. Researcher Elizabeth Murchison tells us how she's fighting to save the Taz, and what she's learning about all cancers from this unusual strain. Contains disturbing images of facial cancer.</description>
Everyone's familiar with cancer, but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease.
The Tasmanian devil has shown us that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease, but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction.
So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?
Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character, the one that spins around and around and around.
But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil, and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo.
The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.
The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger, and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania, which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia.
And despite their ferocious appearance, Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals.
In fact, growing up in Tasmania, it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a Tasmanian devil in the wild.
But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.
And in fact, there's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within 20 to 30 years.
And the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease, a contagious cancer.
The story begins in 1996 when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face.
At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.
Animals, just like humans, sometimes get strange tumors.
However, we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease, which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.
The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996 and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.
Now there's only a small part of the population, which remains unaffected.
This disease appears first as tumors, usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils.
These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors, such as these ones here.
And the next image I'm going to show is quite gruesome.
But inevitably, these tumors progress towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.
This one in particular sticks in my mind, because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself.
And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.
She hadn't eaten for days.
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.
And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils in her pouch.
Of course, they died along with the mother.
They were too young to survive without their mother.
In fact, in the area where she comes from, more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease.
Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer, this infectious cancer, that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.
And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women, which is spread by a virus, and to the AIDS epidemic, which is associated with a number of different types of cancer.
All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus.
However, we now know -- and I'll tell you right now -- that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister, and something that we hadn't really thought of before.
But in order for me to explain what that is, I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself.
Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year.
One in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives.
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only 14.
Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself.
Paradoxically, once established, natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer.
Natural selection is survival of the fittest.
And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells, if one of them acquires new mutations, which allow them to grow more quickly, acquire nutrients more successfully, invade the body, they'll be selected for by evolution.
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.
It evolves.
Throw a drug at it, and resistant cells will grow back.
An amazing fact is that, given the right environment and the right nutrients, a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever.
However cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies, and its continued growth, its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues, leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself.
So cancer could be thought of as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end.
But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation.
And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.
This was work from many people, but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago.
The next slide is going to be gruesome.
This is Jonas.
He's a Tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face.
And being a geneticist, I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.
So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body.
I took these back to the lab.
I extracted DNA from them.
And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA, and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body, I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.
In fact, Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you.
What this told us was that Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body.
In fact, more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil -- and Jonas was clearly a male.
So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face?
Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania.
We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA.
Think about that for a minute.
That means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil, that have broken free of that first devil's body and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.
But how can a cancer spread in a population?
Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.
They tend to bite each other, often quite ferociously and usually on the face.
We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.
When the devil bites another devil, it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil, so the tumor continues to grow.
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer.
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
It spreads through the population, has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system, and it's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction.
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils, why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans?
Well the answer is, it has.
This is Kimbo.
He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.
Last year, his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region.
She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting.
And if you're squeamish, please look away now.
He discovered this, a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis.
The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor, a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs.
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells, so is this dog cancer.
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable, because it spread all around the world.
And in fact, these same cells that are affecting Kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in New York City, in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
In fact, genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old, which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals.
This cancer is remarkable.
It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.
It's a living relic of the distant past.
So we've seen that this can happen in animals.
Could cancers be contagious between people?
Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam, a cancer doctor in the 1950s.
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else.
And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer, who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary.
Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells.
But a small number of them did, and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill -- whose immune systems were probably compromised.
What this tells us, ethical issues aside, is that ...
it's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people.
However, under some circumstances, it can happen.
And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future.
So just finally, cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments.
But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer.
In fact, I believe, given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth, we can defeat cancer.
My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.
Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer.
Thank you.

<title>Derek Paravicini and Adam Ockelford: In the key of genius</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Born three and a half months prematurely, Derek Paravicini is blind and has severe autism. But with perfect pitch, innate talent and a lot of practice, he became an acclaimed concert pianist by the age of 10. Here, his longtime piano teacher, Adam Ockelford, explains his student’s unique relationship to music, while Paravicini shows how he has ripped up the "Chopsticks" rule book. </description>
Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing, but I thought it would just be nice to recap on how Derek got to where he is today.
It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me, but when Derek was born, he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.
He was born three and a half months premature, and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.
He had to have a lot of oxygen, and that affected your eyes, Derek, and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world.
But that was the end of the bad news, because when Derek came home from the hospital, his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you, Derek, really for the rest of your childhood.
And Nanny's great insight, really, was to think, here's a child who can't see.
Music must be the thing for Derek.
And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled, to him for his first few years of life.
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring, some sort of musical gift.
Here's a little picture of Derek going up now, when you were with your nanny.
Now Nanny's great other insight was to think, perhaps we should get Derek something to play, and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft, never thinking really that anything much would come of it.
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it, bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.
But out of all the bashing, after a few months, emerged the most fantastic music, and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek, when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.
That was the great eureka moment.
Now, not being able to see meant, of course, that you taught yourself.
Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.
AO: You did teach yourself to play, and as a consequence, playing the piano for you, Derek, was a lot of knuckles and karate chops, and even a bit of nose going on in there.
And now, here's what Nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had, and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing when you were four years old.
DP: "Molly Malone ."
AO: It wasn't actually "Cockles and Mussels."
This one is "English Country Garden."
DP: "English Country Garden."
AO: There you are.
I think that's just fantastic.
You know, there's this little child who can't see, can't really understand much about the world, has no one in the family who plays an instrument, and yet he taught himself to play that.
And as you can see from the picture, there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing, Derek.
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old, and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest, because when you played the piano, you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard, and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way.
So as soon as I tried to get near the piano, I was firmly shoved off.
And having said to your dad, Nic, that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn't allowed near the piano.
But after a while, I thought, well, the only way is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room, and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back, I could just play something very quickly for him to learn.
And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.
As you can see, there's me in my early, pre-marriage days with a brown beard, and little Derek concentrating there.
I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.
Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really had taken the world by storm.
This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.
And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much, and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key, and all that kind of thing.
But the orchestra were wowed as well, and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces.
Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?
And hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do.
I think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little, Derek, was that by the time you were two, your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.
And so whenever you heard any note at all -- if I just play a random note -- -- you knew instantly what it was, and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.
Now that's called perfect pitch, and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano.
You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek.
But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.
If I just put the microphone down for a bit, I'm going to play a cluster of notes.
Those of you who can see will know how many notes, but Derek, of course, can't.
Not only can you say how many notes, it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.
Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.
And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds, not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing, Derek, you can hear every note, and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice, reproduce those on the keyboard, that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.
Now then.
It's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique, and luckily, Derek, you decided that, once we did start learning, you'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings.
So for example using your thumb under with C major.
Etc.
And in the end, you got so quick, that things like "Flight of the Bumblebee" were no problem, were they?
DP: No.
AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11, Derek was playing things like this.
DP: This.
AO: Derek, let's have a bow.
Well done.
Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek, you could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee" in the usual key, but any note I play, Derek can play it on.
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.
Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note?
DP: "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note.
AO: Or another one? How about in G minor?
DP: G minor.
AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.
So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate, all the pieces in the world that are out there.
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said, "Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee' in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.
In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra, you'd learned the version that you'd learned, and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version, so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert, Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra.
Fantastic chap.
The other wonderful thing about you is memory.
DP: Memory. AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do, we ask the audience to participate, of course, by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all, because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know, you're invited to come and sing it first, and then he'll pick it up."
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.
But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?
DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose? AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.
Would you like to hear me play?
AO: Paganini. DP: "The Theme of Paganini."
AO: Well done.
Derek's going to L.A. soon, and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together, which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?
DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.
AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking, but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.
But in America, they've coined this term, "the human iPod" for Derek, which I think is just missing the point, really, because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.
You're a fantastic, creative musician, and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really, than when we went to Slovenia, and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in, and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.
DP: He played "Chopsticks." AO: And played "Chopsticks."
DP: "Chopsticks."
AO: A bit like this. DP: Like this. Yes.
AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.
He's sitting there.
DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this. AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.
DP: Let Derek play it.
AO: What did you do with it, Derek?
DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.
AO: This is Derek the musician.
Keep up with Derek.
The TED people will kill me, but perhaps there's time for one encore.
DP: For one encore. AO: One encore, yes.
So this is one of Derek's heroes.
It's the great Art Tatum -- DP: Art Tatum.
AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see, and also, I think, like Derek, thought that all the world was a piano, so whenever Art Tatum plays something, it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.
And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on "Tiger Rag."
DP: "Tiger Rag."

<title>Bjorn Lomborg: Global priorities bigger than climate change</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Given $50 billion to spend, which would you solve first, AIDS or global warming? Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg comes up with surprising answers.</description>
What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" -- probably that's also a good choice.
But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?
And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.
So get out your pen and paper.
Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.
I'm just going to list some of them.
There are 800 million people starving.
There's a billion people without clean drinking water.
Two billion people without sanitation.
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.
The lists go on and on.
There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on.
There are many, many problems out there.
In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.
We don't actually solve all problems.
And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves -- and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say, if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves, which ones should we solve first?
And that's the question I'd like to ask you.
If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world, where should we spend it?
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world, and I will just briefly read them: climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.
We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world.
The obvious question would be to ask, what do you think are the biggest things?
Where should we start on solving these problems?
But that's a wrong problem to ask.
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.
But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.
Because we can't solve problems.
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.
But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?
So the point is not to prioritize problems, but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.
And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated.
To climate change that would be like Kyoto.
To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.
To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do, is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities.
And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do, first.
What should be at the bottom of the list?
Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor, and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues.
The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean, I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did.
And I also strongly encourage you, and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards, to think about, how do we actually prioritize?
Of course, you have to ask yourself, why on Earth was such a list never done before?
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.
Nobody wants to do this.
Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.
And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list.
We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years, yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world, and said, which of them should we do first?
So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing -- any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing, if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization, and went in and talked about it.
So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have, for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.
There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.
We have not had an idea.
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card, but you have no idea what the price is.
You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.
It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.
It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
We'd like to know these things.
And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues.
And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.
We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.
So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.
What can we do? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that?
Likewise in communicable diseases.
Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?
What would be the price?
What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?
And so on.
Then we had some of the world's top economists, eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates, meet in Copenhagen in May 2004.
We called them the "dream team."
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics.
That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.
And then you ask, why economists?
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- -- because that's a very good question.
The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria, you ask a malaria expert.
If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first, you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.
That is what economists do.
They prioritize.
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first, and which one should we do afterwards?
So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.
Of course, you can also see it on the website, and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically, projects where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.
Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.
And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.
I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects.
These were the bad projects.
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.
This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back, either.
And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.
Why is it it came up?
And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto -- or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient.
It's not saying that global warming is not happening.
It's not saying that it's not a big problem.
But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little, at a very high cost.
What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models, is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.
That's a substantial amount of money.
That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year.
Yet it would do very little good.
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.
Which is a little good, but not very much good.
So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.
And just to give you a sense of reference, the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount, for about 75 billion dollars a year, we could solve all major basic problems in the world.
We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet.
So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good?
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project.
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.
But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.
The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these -- but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it, simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.
It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.
Again, what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation.
If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.
Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important, but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria.
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations.
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years, we could bring that incidence down to half.
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying, but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people getting infected every year.
We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.
This third best one was free trade.
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World.
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years.
That would be the third best thing we could do.
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.
Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.
Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars, we could make a severe inroad into that problem.
That would be the second best investment that we could do.
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.
Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years, we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.
One is treatment; the other one is prevention.
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.
And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.
So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention.
Basically for the amount of money that we spend, we can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in prevention.
So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate.
What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.
I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say, did you get it right?
Or did you get close to what we came up with here?
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.
We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.
But of course, we don't do all problems.
There are many problems out there in the world.
And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems, that we focus on the right ones.
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.
And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.
One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years, when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be, people will be much, much richer.
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today.
Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.
And of course, we'll be even richer than that.
But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people, or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100, we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.
We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.
And so the real point, of course, is to say, do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little, 100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?
Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh, who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?
Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be -- a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100, thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change, and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more, and who needed the help so much more?"
So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight.
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.
Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.
We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right?
It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something.
It just doesn't make for as much of a movie.
So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems.
To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.
It's not about making things that have the most media attention, but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.
The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.
Of course, we should do all things, in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree.
I think we should do all things, but we don't.
In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.
Since then our aid has halved.
So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems.
Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?
You know, we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don't we spend that on doing good in the world?
I'm all for that.
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.
But the point, of course, is still to say, if you get another 100 billion dollars, we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities.
I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?
You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.
And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world.
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem.
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university, and they spoke English.
The majority of them were, first, from developing countries.
They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists.
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom.
We've done this many other times.
There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.
They all come out with very much the same list.
And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities, and saying, what is the important thing in the world?
Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.
But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.
We did it in 2004, and we hope to assemble many more people, getting much better information for 2008, 2012.
Map out the right path for the world -- but also to start thinking about political triage.
To start thinking about saying, "Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now."
At the end of the day, you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these, but we have to be honest and frank about saying, if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.
If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things.
So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world.
Thank you.

<title>Bill Gates: Mosquitos, malaria and education</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Bill Gates hopes to solve some of the world's biggest problems using a new kind of philanthropy. In a passionate and, yes, funny 18 minutes, he asks us to consider two big questions and how we might answer them. </description>
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation, sharing some of the problems.
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing.
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally.
That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things.
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to.
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths.
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five.
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
It's a phenomenal thing.
Each one of those lives matters a lot.
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs: vaccines that were used more widely.
For example, measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000.
So we really can make changes.
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
Why? Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths: diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
Well, what's the history of this disease?
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
In fact, if we look at the genetic code, it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
So it was absolutely gigantic.
And the disease was all over the world.
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s, when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
So it was everywhere.
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
Now, ironically, what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment.
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria.
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
And rich men are afflicted.
And so that's why that priority has been set.
But, malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact.
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much.
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.
And bed nets are a great tool.
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night, so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
And that's happened now in a number of countries.
It's great to see.
But we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
And so you end up with two choices.
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way, you do it vigorously, you can actually get a local eradication.
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly, for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden, but eventually those tools will become ineffective, and the death rate will soar back up again.
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
Now we're on the upswing.
Bed net funding is up.
There's new drug discovery going on.
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months.
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
So we're going to have these new tools.
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.
Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things.
It involves communicators to keep the funding high, to keep the visibility high, to tell the success stories.
It involves social scientists, so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets, but 90 percent.
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this, to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
And so as these elements come together, I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria.
Now let me turn to a second question, a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on, and we'd understand very well.
And the answer is, really, that we don't.
Let's start with why this is important.
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.
We all had a wonderful education.
That's part of the reason we're here today, part of the reason we're successful.
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.
I had great teachers.
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world, if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront.
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis, but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education.
And we have to change this.
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.
We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education, like science and mathematics.
When I first learned the statistics, I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.
They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent.
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.
And even if you graduate from high school, if you're low-income, you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.
If you're low-income in the United States, you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree.
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.
So, how do you make education better?
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.
There's many people working on it.
We've worked on small schools, we've funded scholarships, we've done things in libraries.
A lot of these things had a good effect.
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing.
And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers, between, say, the top quartile -- the very best -- and the bottom quartile.
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class -- based on test scores -- by over 10 percent in a single year.
What does that mean?
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years, had top quartile teachers, the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
We should retain those people.
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?
What do they look like?
You might think these must be very senior teachers.
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree.
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.
They're taking data, the test scores, and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms, at first it's very bizarre.
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
What's going on?"
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention, which kids were bored, and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
It was a very dynamic environment, because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade -- keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention, nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.
Everybody needs to be involved.
And so KIPP is doing it.
How does that compare to a normal school?
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
The data isn't gathered.
In the teacher's contract, it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -- sometimes to once per year.
And they need advanced notice to do that.
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers, some of them just making crap and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year, but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you, and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.
They don't have the test scores, and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
For example, New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers.
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
But I'm optimistic about this, I think there are some clear things we can do.
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on, and that's given us the picture of where we are.
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well, and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
Of course, digital video is cheap now.
Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools.
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
If you have a kid who's behind, you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet, but you could make it so that DVDs were always available, and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better.
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."
And I thought it was so fantastic.
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
Now, we put a lot of money into education, and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting -- the House version actually had money in it for these data systems, and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things.
But I -- I'm optimistic.
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
I only had time to frame those two problems.

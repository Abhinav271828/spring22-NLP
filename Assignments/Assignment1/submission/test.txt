I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.
This is all I can say today.
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.
Can you?
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.
This event must underpin enlargement.
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.
Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.
Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is largely due to historical factors.
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.
I think the statement' s content makes this clear.
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF?
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO.
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues.
In a sense this is where its work begins.
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.
It plays down one of the Treaties' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.
In six months' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation' s effects upon the Commission' s role.
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services.
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.
The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.
What is your opinion on that?
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.
In other words, it is positive discrimination.
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so.
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998.
Modernising social protection
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments.
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.
A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden.
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.
Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party.
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.
Uniformity needs to be worked on.
I might never have studied otherwise.
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.
The foul monster has been reawakened!
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.
That is our duty.
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country.
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.
I do hope that this will not be necessary.
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.
We will also pass this on to our services, however.
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.
(Parliament gave its assent) President.
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.
The polluter should pay.
Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide.
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.
What kind of horse-trading system is this?
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?
Question Time (Council)
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.
I also reject this line of argument.
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.
Tourism and employment
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.
We can therefore welcome its adoption.
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.
Coordination is the key word here.
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today.
Resumption of the session
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.
Compare it with what happens in December.
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999.
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.
What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.
This is why the National Front voted against the report.
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.
In the case of Turkey it is different.
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.
The European Parliament and the Union' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.
Please support the Austrian people against this government!
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.
(Applause)
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.
Intergovernmental Conference
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.
That is not what we want to do in Europe.
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.
This report is about the Commission.
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?
We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is.
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.
Did these firms need state aid to survive?
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.
I would be in favour of its doing so.
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.
NATO is largely European.
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.
We are all immigrants.
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.
This constitutes a good example, therefore.
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.
Relating to Amendment No 6
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.
Who would want this to happen?
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?
The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament.
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.
We do not think so.
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.
The common position is not ambitious enough.
It must be seen to deliver.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.
These aspects are very much interconnected.
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.
It is fine, in principle.
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.
It will be there for some time to come.
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.
Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions' way of working.
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.
We are now unable to guide the peace.
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.
We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate.
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.
We need stronger banking supervision.
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions.
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle.
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money?
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.
Agreement on comitology
Thank you for your reply.
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.
We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.
But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.
It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.
What she has said here is completely justified.
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.
It is for life.
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%.
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings.
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it.
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.
That would seem odd to me.
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.
What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased.
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict.
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.
(Applause)
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.
You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.
When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence.
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.
Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.
Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment.
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.
Colleagues, you know the rules.
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted.
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!
I am very concerned about these translation problems which, unfortunately, we seem to be having increasingly, and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed.
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.
Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.
However, I should like to ask a slightly different question.
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.
We are not talking about words here.
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.
Here too there is at least some progress.
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report.
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.
There was no majority for this at the time.
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.
I am talking about Milosevic.
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union' s financial programmes and instruments.
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.
(Applause)
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.
That shows that competition really is working.
(Applause)
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.
However, we must be realistic.
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?
The debate is closed.
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.
and
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue.
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support.
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.
This I think is the new Convention.
This is very much on their minds.
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.
So again, rhetoric and reality.
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.
So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary.
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.
(Parliament approved the joint text)
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.
Firstly, for the single market.
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.
We think there are other positive advances too.
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense.
. I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.
There is no other such policy.
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.
Madam President, we simply have a few translation problems in this area too.
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy.
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.
The New York stage is different from Geneva.
I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....
Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process.
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.
That is the way it should be.
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.
The Commission guideline document for the new structural fund' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises.
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities.
You can see it in different countries.
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):
On paper!
We want instruments to prevent abuse.
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.
Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money.
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.
This issue is extremely serious.
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.
Who will provide us with new jobs?
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.
This too has not been solved.
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions.
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.
One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field.
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.
Proposal for a joint resolution on the Commission' s 5 year Strategic Programme
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.
What about women?
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.
These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries.
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.
But Europe is changing.
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.
The matter of the European Union' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.
What can the Commission do about that?
We want to encourage debate among the people.
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.
These include, for example, costs and transfers.
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.
The two proposals form a coherent whole.
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment.
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.
I have given you my answer.
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.
The Commission has no means of influence here.
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.
At the beginning of December 1999, the first round of negotiations were held in New York, after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island.
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.
So much for the first comment.
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable.
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive.
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence.
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.
I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past.
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy.
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.
By then, my children will be older than I am now.
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.

t this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	83.42074578387667
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	39.30282226981178
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	88.95545284636081
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	51.581688414517814
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.	32.31650414804924
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	65.75494508744072
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	206.9354049054624
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	42.21369827612368
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	92.65425347659067
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	69.36085944362063
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks.	406.86942441573484
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.	115.91388919345366
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products.	113.11859367113027
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	112.38946807630012
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	137.4594651612377
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	96.10995063752698
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	215.19072979751974
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	155.30355218476404
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	248.4518951545552
As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.	74.82895273555583
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	71.25230694469982
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	59.00823516373527
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	87.38459246788415
Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.	55.53930987052846
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	400.6573348641401
The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	91.39590875427437
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	17.548737129706595
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	1356.896548212436
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	32.948018147056764
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	93.98124620041729
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	73.9175447769815
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	202.01880964626784
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	43.18634695466846
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	44.868390403495916
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	294.0061823219563
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	149.77989162848405
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.	317.5370283824
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	45.33809321430234
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	127.38227874137944
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	187.18538397919866
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	208.55658590281084
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	90.52038405806357
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	76.50179025765462
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	53.9977547642117
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	54.1882003605313
I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.	33.189695280708946
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	89.42644801893397
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	35.0364844012191
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	67.25726504814295
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	61.59524182521722
He has done really good work in a very short time.	66.49109500540773
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	50.378246074525435
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	114.68137200780102
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.	229.28769535452795
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	22.28690999863909
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	72.32707128409483
What happens in another part of the world affects us.	152.05329577554332
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	110.04534842674066
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	70.89834505968653
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	88.89056548638953
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	117.64353125058925
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	172.7336552343924
The question is: who prosecutes?	77.04592942197895
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	37.109091755119934
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	115.35991160031074
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	501.2429564445612
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	185.90722866461226
This has been talked about for years.	57.50713815891879
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	88.03759748346113
We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	69.42403455628032
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	86.77439111184789
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	212.8400694004463
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	69.88640519508962
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	199.684212169782
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	164.8325854138002
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	57.81270733871288
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	104.918387628346
The motion also asks that a position document, drawn up by the Commission and Council, should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.	102.2794221622702
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	64.78725453013857
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	128.0964804318192
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	133.2820051530992
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	154.90141565427126
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	30.7790624988332
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	55.81248131377514
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.	91.75264218667313
We are always saying think globally, act locally.	314.7192365937654
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	170.22364682570796
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	39.20988370172603
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.	153.4085269886573
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	94.4049673519206
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.	79.71735154424347
(Applause)	9.643449649493618
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	31.496813816162803
This debate, I think, has summed it up.	62.005708890940575
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	90.28271229770755
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.	55.52122930516669
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	109.37570508274769
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	86.31087384978066
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	63.951080586970676
You can see it in different countries.	63.74702169249802
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	104.9886532913757
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	55.89359911811249
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	41.220738341296496
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	192.73047966254106
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	169.8600925959966
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	122.02467046375524
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	186.45897900481546
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	71.0421566237919
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	168.62416454153046
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	43.60329062008652
They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive.	137.97680906557872
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	189.57096519080343
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	15.64152197878963
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.	116.99666782997421
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	33.59567273831021
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	85.88169711532991
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	126.34948408567672
There are many opportunities to hide.	132.64385869061772
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	199.91593859476254
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	141.11819108009576
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.	145.19938721638655
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	66.53227591291423
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	37.419558054549434
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	144.85188971067953
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	63.75869719835043
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.	361.87099926280126
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	316.4083435519741
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	145.9954318205236
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme.	38.51116065834207
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	59.62508348167727
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	114.14149676783887
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	126.53692250670728
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	42.56291748535627
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	62.11219404537432
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	210.15986603858076
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	81.86542276820006
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	213.9701943976746
The debate is closed.	3.205099911743051
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	153.66426403905274
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	109.40727391996337
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	47.48429650292862
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	102.65262603591238
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	42.27646647554135
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	96.8805390033232
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	81.16952009447587
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity.	95.88502186897676
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	99.94538950461427
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	200.0162553507121
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource.	125.16511421416769
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	46.11372541414236
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	146.49753067546595
Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental.	421.91172101139523
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	235.08878063619792
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.	64.7188177982165
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	42.07111046039974
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	357.2606828796829
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	152.35124621887533
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	250.78334395538934
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	89.29725660596992
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	54.33678644262162
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	126.46618593487922
The debate is closed.	3.205099911743051
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	158.13584588785258
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	40.403055768712704
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	100.72667745706056
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	66.70135129281981
.	540.9794592043837
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	62.229765431412744
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	280.60693306401583
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	101.64450576805272
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	162.8436060294088
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	212.40729139198893
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	85.94050433233433
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.	57.028105711094135
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	277.80859827441054
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	202.70299016236848
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	127.36482430284676
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13.	99.52087258668791
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	55.73549720326081
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	170.38895811294617
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	172.4735861845598
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	146.32991694336573
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	303.52319352389674
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	201.95319437333376
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	115.16440121664577
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.	19.705665048263622
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	113.8669951773917
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	40.52385327073606
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	97.65643397543586
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	62.14370960341815
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	72.58122751980959
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	197.5292132292485
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	105.31184389997594
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	196.5953962767369
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	91.28863632239874
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	137.35616784803443
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	27.41350402020115
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue.	74.82066969593119
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	94.01843254109248
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	35.92763882262972
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon.	112.05009524742138
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	115.38121085755125
SAVE	162426954096.26086
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	121.42467417445421
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	237.4450269398871
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	246.819413250722
It must be visible.	15.278829085627521
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	143.703151519673
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	84.93482631907057
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!	57.57831574495667
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.	35.68161012317857
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	22.97124942352452
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	189.023469322371
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	143.32325296407652
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	508.67115718321486
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	319.9072066569059
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	278.2635381733827
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	79.31978588786362
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	35.154120081991245
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	204.07827644893624
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	56.99081443669397
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	140.9367929554832
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	388.5669806252231
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	33.55664954932293
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	72.5506027820913
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	489.6036402317141
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	195.7698308297159
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	102.55661159075545
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	56.553135021929535
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	57.001943301173114
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	89.6116152784589
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	154.33255164004558
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	126.29436995132706
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	109.02696081438842
That statement could not be much clearer.	634.6286627506269
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	83.56169532799264
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	357.7753198118266
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	108.58287612852254
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	22.060176578548628
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.	40.730917084335815
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy?	53.0194013131322
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	145.02500723751106
Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.	13.60149378301419
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	179.24964677644337
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	55.858827194285745
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	34.203817874030925
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	780.315455421835
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	222.18744888700846
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	121.9351855651166
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence.	96.47950205553897
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.	176.58162700582784
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	187.4915060157136
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	131.51507160628452
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	67.94267839979904
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	202.74195667902396
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	220.99686760363628
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	67.71203096636657
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	228.8910670069209
This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States.	57.72528246658719
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	28.59262051585959
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	77.42789420441288
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	117.37236602693137
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions.	39.69397728147721
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	59.169127410525334
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law.	56.82646701054247
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement.	124.9792622574109
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	57.412987605151784
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	77.98992837898763
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.	474.5129875219395
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	29.457116736100208
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	57.36018275918129
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	184.75536644025377
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	90.49296417645563
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	62.16179133670527
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	200.97718872486325
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	15.19346383097708
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	202.09670382663143
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	57.34165531451552
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	16.306815981121552
Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided.	87.08131342141698
VOTE	2998.8871674448283
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	76.17334905125882
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	104.96023585446967
Women have different individual needs and interests.	577.7877876957359
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	146.398823386436
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	32.44698149943548
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	71.20140543685616
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	133.72460796297605
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	130.48586661435857
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	118.81867013817543
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	65.47143616345129
Underground networks?	1022.3164430768238
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	145.7452070752871
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	77.96670836066149
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	64.89167134548806
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	34.48225201062287
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	98.42000609583137
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	37.72098661231539
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	638.6527689143012
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	90.52168297945376
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	172.78272665514595
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	47.391584526270734
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	67.39978809677407
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	92.59242293844306
Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	25.573760578700387
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	152.18497227712493
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	59.35548052843412
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	21.430811544051892
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	312.88138343111876
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	774.3052938683055
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	15.74430154127481
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	410.1776031554543
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	73.02177939377727
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	77.9401460248187
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	329.3748231613391
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	96.39654049440524
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	160.14418845595998
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	114.45103407119825
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	21.586652441053328
We shall now proceed to the vote.	3.2182270650431892
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	86.99116788697809
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	62.48751686907416
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	147.09890545602477
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	66.54518759568728
(Applause)	9.643449649493618
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	246.19180240659884
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	97.28351631884912
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	70.95142131739713
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	175.1285006954484
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	59.52098395064447
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	48.85580946714972
. (DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations.	59.60505222278885
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.	163.11334560204472
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	39.77128461567117
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	1081.1039133207767
This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat.	76.64009574055132
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy.	37.386800314540444
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	92.7546794011253
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	162.33419135305115
So much for the first comment.	68.68818184599137
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	92.07188398916985
It is not just a question of style.	19.523565101321356
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	5.713635202253511
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	45.747091216064526
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	222.56300924321616
Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS))	10.277075912659999
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	110.48265338950283
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	62.856601901489654
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	66.73577818026615
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	44.636534377961496
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	623.328973968812
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.	24.060895487167144
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	92.9529599241665
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	51.16391029374683
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	137.94125276000787
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	94.57138551160226
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	183.1854074648993
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	253.88305372870414
Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	46.86343265055215
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	159.26849909993282
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.	250.4970360270264
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	146.7266320199089
I was told that this was a personal response.	57.10098286135058
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	18.562034318989912
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	75.83525876052016
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	121.93557501619559
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	25.63236838530205
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.	100.37567863670937
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	153.9858652074529
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	81.31410668695145
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	70.80551524755677
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	178.7894089357163
The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.	85.44370713436658
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	151.23512084236873
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	103.61303313619229
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	40.742265592205506
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	62.45970137254751
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	189.51413646540004
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	28.227496318670553
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	63.61736989510801
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	49.65012493921796
Has any thought been given to the matter?	342.16837472411265
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	155.50852614833255
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	119.19354891320943
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.	121.86231714110426
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU' s external action.	121.61414616456811
That is not correct.	26.103253265107167
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	32.175950287062214
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	123.60934717604442
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	66.07065268542217
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	234.09987941393243
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	42.18054753881721
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	45.390986254249476
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	38.87373366283561
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	28.118150347526413
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	50.96223778968802
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	90.50610631611603
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	79.17147061769937
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	447.32950698991067
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	283.9960805192504
That concludes the debate.	5.877520909475019
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	220.3907093191285
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	83.54524476851826
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	39.875835569706716
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	64.89781267578674
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken.	160.38690235754407
. (SV) Olle Schmidt' s report is an improvement on the Commission' s proposal.	14.530318835945337
Should we complain about this delay?	251.780265441317
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	25.278043568387034
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	61.38984871244249
That concludes questions to the Council.	6.688446727528161
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	2.066348125468589
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.	183.37593932019183
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	200.21016898805078
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	82.19742655253332
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	52.58724766057194
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	157.4223459622701
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	664.2899440873637
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	76.548499722456
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	62.718620678515634
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	38.47912418632676
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	115.46875488796246
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	73.71515150144081
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	303.1856169926777
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	112.65067558890928
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	232.45484991096973
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	147.17691825849454
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.	382.3942394956592
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	132.34987501784047
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	180.56887723947116
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	206.0766436608184
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	95.56247535328413
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	56.97820787753548
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	217.36746593289388
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	214.00449372341384
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	53.688235812728564
However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.	28.186679925339977
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	30.705120822684236
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	363.6414909236806
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	50.87435164934315
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	107.91430733152613
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions.	335.5356456892729
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	31.225544359031502
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	32.95617059358532
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	61.30847381059087
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	109.7147075309015
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	182.6308470877982
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	54.555709978275814
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	105.92261273428998
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	156.65180236373487
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	151.7124571151231
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	1809.182521622858
There is no other such policy.	62.76005082704092
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	34.784247031956916
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	150.41292713297716
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	166.83134992608026
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	52.52441182743586
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	172.9012909099724
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	39.80214563257736
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	103.5686379646474
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	170.96317611089972
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.	28.69049330634875
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	42.85365726636143
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	104.79068014785489
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	13.71335472708761
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	77.5605805889926
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	151.88337658268892
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary.	243.32367350927302
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	9.933158892881579
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	188.44992940407855
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	48.215959488579365
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	74.33614223724372
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	93.79075168529039
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	52.71007894165967
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	75.13841210922489
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	106.2307531529908
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	79.60396122919656
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	309.43054170574095
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	147.7149785428752
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	137.04832791257485
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	196.51603210925515
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	85.1519327623298
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	82.96874374473538
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	3.0717119768338765
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	3.394146067111154
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	46.59971433203637
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	185.6495495883127
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	846.1312315323602
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	57.141873174572986
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	215.66437243756394
And just as well, in my view.	41.805336900089785
At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly.	99.21479280528534
Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission.	87.66032547514286
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	123.15849279705866
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	158.98218364270403
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	42.02296464712351
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	17.286710351071783
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	11.641529527273727
This is why I am voting against the report.	7.999747778999864
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	98.12123239356508
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health.	145.59046532184541
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	93.99005042651639
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	6.575147183337529
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	80.11356225884097
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	113.10411985900988
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	23.913796659301376
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	113.37044320290099
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent.	559.0543006230257
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	465.26632608176834
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	97.86101433489495
The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.	75.03764353983944
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	164.9189430327433
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas.	76.20029037347597
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.	251.19110985167882
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	22.320390895110357
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	134.46158222784396
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	103.21189002404095
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	219.85328146246937
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	53.8323315132716
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	155.85462633714857
.	540.9794592043837
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	133.98891656625725
I will tell you a few things we should do.	74.22226183826332
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	73.11366569131363
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	39.611755958006135
Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another.	314.2695965997207
He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."	612.5773115163887
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	77.41554336353123
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	38.604447538243726
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen.	1312.6070363180072
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	109.22745102176975
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	79.13985119001106
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	117.03292085557524
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	232.70269134324852
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	24.47686284811384
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	92.47730202949207
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	88.36230183130421
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it.	80.48722293016448
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	116.08108116778818
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	222.98376906629804
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	90.67192991496107
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	3.237118840320778
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.	21.006871383764466
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	162.20302989649528
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	67.57924461623249
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	41.22477039271768
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	115.73992368141832
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	104.29727152339906
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	27.397491035000844
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	126.99431237955581
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	288.5967230081937
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	125.77859108960867
Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	74.01377798665698
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	91.34880437212104
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	128.58102980129817
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	86.76281047122993
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer' s freedom of choice.	115.45584840485806
Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000)	19.9865724876805
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	294.2692645093151
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	149.0569830851632
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	150.17028399303442
One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	146.66251752530326
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	38.667700731258655
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	105.93135461484478
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	78.90771717366135
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.	20.22143527592941
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	325.11134696117415
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	76.73256271555827
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	126.95137870358197
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	152.02843766544595
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	121.61191235619158
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	57.262724565464865
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	166.51724276960323
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	78.87152781050176
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	121.25719440540183
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	246.52914336774973
Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	163.15881847994987
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	106.13772546028072
What has become of it?	264.38587922404565
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	599.7381890172998
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	230.89633454772348
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	80.60668912063082
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	70.8664414202042
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	212.3305753134007
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	346.55277573231297
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	76.98375172869983
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	152.0138144704891
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	86.42629225823643
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	103.22397906574477
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	17.629307090537992
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	107.3220570026997
We want EQUAL to go ahead.	101.48446730805607
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	58.75994622703701
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	59.36343781064835
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	188.44722785847344
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	72.16587423966718
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	47.9042261616695
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.	89.30054689479896
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	84.58396319533357
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	39.42025492249449
Report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD))	5.353524053448901
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others.	354.9941591324396
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.	173.05675862127202
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	23.514763593300422
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	63.45295351410097
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	78.18838632479041
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.	96.57358098619997
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	458.50694381484203
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	113.24170663914896
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	337.69078802558784
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	74.83438467230766
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	61.21352905996832
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	60.332647821260956
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	30.080411412362547
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	284.6058869173901
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	83.29508278833036
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	186.9625178590065
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	118.66323645358678
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	121.54597765838459
Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	22.537285068962635
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments.	957.6163565532477
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.	106.20144101070845
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	60.934081960737345
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	20.810551452663475
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	245.0773571868099
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	138.95581608463294
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	242.25093098349973
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	2.026483186081912
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.	97.721827129024
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	26.077138919375134
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.	151.8885576464709
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved.	11.04501860934811
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	51.26274190111329
Report (A5-0012/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established within the Community (COM(99)0003 - C5-0050/2000 - 1999/0013(CNS))	5.469286356130002
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	43.267510400156695
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	245.59566574836867
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	172.31660778831588
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.	46.660619325529645
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	56.9876161781538
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	2.89480519926993
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	25.694206528788964
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.	104.84580639685724
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	191.09386329610172
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	145.74729214829995
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	200.01730605545998
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	53.82276424714171
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	152.90360885869052
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	123.52545560335048
First of all: who should pay?	59.78892298233865
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	90.32439093564527
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	82.20017757888294
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	26.988641228139816
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	376.63218027483606
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	29.20829889517938
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	112.55691122707765
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	109.07543362603184
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	68.07871152880115
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	331.670953711938
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	427.57523820737316
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	95.31930074356167
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	266.3891209365481
I think the statement' s content makes this clear.	113.37800600681209
As far as we are concerned, they will be.	10.600204402829025
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	30.15086386761409
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	122.10547353092568
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	128.9850869984323
Capital tax	2045758.3219555125
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	177.46015242516646
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	46.323314786752384
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	229.55613870811047
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	1025.1072170894652
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report.	117.3416035174533
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	111.74112581158215
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	46.608308829854806
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	187.94216596993203
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	121.90884267288693
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	89.74918004206577
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	257.63225725502036
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	125.51365202348646
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.	140.36631128243044
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	33.57877367245433
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	71.79990871954752
The investment needs to be visionary.	40.266484970248875
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	29.249593157543654
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds.	40.28521772968291
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	52.67274554825915
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	88.3600322895212
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	35.64720279478612
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	418.3980713089245
This is a big task but it can be done.	55.88399173899143
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	184.6360017339201
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	14.020459502898223
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	31.242250412426557
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	191.64185912639044
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	109.071285220449
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	119.64356086155345
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process.	84.25210794120336
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	14.020650281338327
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	83.7388651661857
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	79.93944424235943
In response I can only say that this already exists.	92.71420019393861
Whose turn is next?	19348.018897334347
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	84.16261069077075
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	71.24586537716408
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	21.62347259133851
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children.	198.0710806561068
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.	167.60108507490625
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	45.08915265991238
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	73.78402858047103
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	94.32930909161965
.	540.9794592043837
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	246.14226341005897
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	61.42619458756693
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	24.333848169940666
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	140.22897631227696
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	94.58479939702234
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	39.441886402765725
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	55.1542376768673
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	105.89070789376179
I endorse this view.	305.6244588673868
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	39.55473077383194
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	92.38956573260621
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	305.9486974536696
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	45.92347939185664
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	180.24877119925586
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	174.6095720648204
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	55.55054516065611
Current programmes must be accelerated.	537.1489190063343
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	52.249872669604905
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	116.79844916371813
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	135.66596714951163
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	21.2127211193558
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.	276.0472473239234
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	84.69877713055857
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	68.05959850256829
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	79.24658328474065
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	31.09820799788179
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	862.5346599307213
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	92.2845241160573
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	91.40841732294476
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	78.16716362151384
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	25.839027764954388
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	240.37758109008448
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	66.71224757810995
This is no longer tolerable.	7.964909005820504
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	17.894276391150512
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	6.6638449050703406
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	79.4578624780425
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	39.29408537889659
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	202.79615605071965
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	263.4676963472828
They are already having implications for resource availability.	648.2901431745432
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	142.33094439583658
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	69.47696765470596
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	49.92286621526661
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	55.31867736665167
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	48.91399052343941
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	96.5314780585636
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	307.1026620977265
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	72.8020181160035
Even by this stage, that is already too many by far.	186.49474193440216
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	139.52839975883492
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	113.59392914582213
Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer?	183.94811668194131
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	61.48672034173155
I want to emphasise four points.	65.16264186081953
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	30.524547223628648
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	41.28102181862825
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	89.79857404747308
I think they should have.	53.037980405911846
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	112.22077590101034
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	245.6399553134654
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	203.57944717180322
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	65.38246460957369
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	452.2269992024107
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	99.3307488357217
This is a big problem in my opinion.	64.77854208219141
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	128.96799774744707
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	50.96894002350907
They have paid already.	242.3933688491229
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	144.8379569904897
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	343.43282835864875
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	118.94829216655943
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	76.32410889022428
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	107.26224171854503
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	29.028629656542126
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	92.19270899252595
This is the crux of the matter.	8.366759673943612
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	2.9532717432771154
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	39.381156144064065
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.	96.8341824048523
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	111.28017510967501
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	214.43160089018352
This is a basic element of the decision.	29.299271741348914
The delta of the Danube is in danger.	27.741750084505178
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	75.8221773318379
Why would it not work elsewhere?	762.828371023557
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	148.58259178093937
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	592.5990914371542
We are looking for solutions.	46.42073040614596
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	131.9860726555959
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice.	92.15289480838202
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	119.67010183699021
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	64.05627288179181
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	72.6868486769075
The debate is closed.	3.205099911743051
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	26.64447411845751
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	71.99585613948682
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	203.50948371352342
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	61.9273072314782
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	30.053265934025983
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	50.89730558053873
For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	57.912125608632365
Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' .	112.82650168917421
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	43.575347870565615
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	71.4823918487563
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	85.284544232661
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	105.51537895113884
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	20.930288891532626
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	111.21229987877919
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	471.1261214741217
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	219.08829274294624
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	55.61690711630339
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	115.62842036000626
.	540.9794592043837
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	548.2394709779595
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	28.825949007892422
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	117.53291165273096
There is still much to be done, however.	23.458590695058447
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	127.92906988587991
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	186.60238314546135
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	297.07290836437244
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	60.82178622577355
For this reason, it is essential that the Council' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	58.56364004206207
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	50.437708786581496
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	54.55786334651077
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.	46.81995536199495
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	100.2941917240863
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	84.14769036216703
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	92.65300845791307
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event.	182.94285890926886
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	73.73363088670209
Proposal for a joint resolution on coherence of different Union policies	28.58100012243826
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	168.23990776789626
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	164.9841808504832
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	147.77275966070133
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	287.28295472210004
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)	2.4415641470014795
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	101.20494101306737
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	19.604855863112757
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	74.69627255345337
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?	119.32210292119167
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	60.07717485669746
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	59.278734617905386
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	308.70589361309663
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.	251.6401330757226
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	27.34760775345897
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	66.84542766777507
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	90.56400573934894
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	157.33458518080215
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	48.07706664552242
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	98.25593331548063
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	141.6756147178325
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	77.8590372223247
I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence.	146.15907656019482
The first is greater transparency.	38.14072388101562
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	90.92244368124159
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	35.210327349748866
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	490.2538973691302
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	110.69909579467704
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	169.3966384434028
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	99.63752549531216
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	454.5234773115278
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	8.065535435493853
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	60.41503920684977
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	127.17968446325656
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	54.12163315197051
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.	375.6888895737288
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	344.63862066275817
That is my first question.	13.613394537411507
(Parliament gave its assent)	4.275407048372422
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	59.200207947630524
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	53.58264369250659
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	102.50414367493713
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	163.19982559250113
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	94.23157322890849
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	118.5260533089764
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	164.11384751102887
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	72.35879846225933
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	266.1020936026951
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	68.13487357221034
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	51.89731071952098
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	160.25142185216652
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	22.747498972479992
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	59.39368068671631
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	113.50984042716044
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	210.89734790616757
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly.	137.7332950496458
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	23.25012595051091
As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.	153.17728412181035
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	34.58800921513666
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	56.50062692999108
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	189.98796527070238
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	361.21727563293354
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	119.44432376438436
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	109.53998584463633
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	153.00098368622062
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	98.1672649721877
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	88.88026322434371
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	96.74276722562038
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.	7.241585782234088
But the source is threatening to run dry.	581.5450769334493
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	149.08744967867906
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	248.25059373840162
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	223.66686047074728
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	929.2962150838547
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	105.64208927698174
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	32.83385232718458
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	3.042190308133514
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	157.13268808085593
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	210.12710707104762
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	155.92838067369425
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	135.43025833817282
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	116.55271975262065
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	104.77017546465845
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	39.303933977466585
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	210.33580135310854
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	67.59100986997451
And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.	110.09906198287163
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.	318.5627459611536
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	153.19638514130753
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	13.386246371413808
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	184.45165456563956
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	65.70913236615621
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	51.058214419568344
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	54.966061631910236
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	228.47797031566262
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	38.10613096616161
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	18.46336898722223
There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.	87.7655242154315
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	669.3503614697349
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	95.11230323441913
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	41.695245599187274
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	118.40337973350775
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	67.11698307423796
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	108.91142787039426
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	139.9643694496958
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	119.89720447273321
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	242.7409822080614
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	353.56072135903247
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.	22.384715524667072
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	66.3701567193326
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	58.69661885872224
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	42.533373611888926
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	53.50365292962348
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.	281.49954598714373
That, however, is not my question.	46.78543518274496
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	81.092216841332
That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks.	37.7804557117892
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	252.40202179270528
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	79.67243032219231
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	32.51251806443335
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	142.99077394456467
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	63.758563361434305
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	189.7268192546685
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	71.7054314909743
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	105.02184990474986
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.	84.69905265280553
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	199.65127687140847

5.133071978651511
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	3.3056467815070087
Thank you for your attention.	7.088392180046676
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	4.761843998842916
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.	5.11419440724584
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	2.675772964846618
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.	4.9904838519572925
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	5.446625097721077
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	3.6661554698548193
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	7.623171801406931
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	5.239034388217409
I am, however, optimistic.	11.306674665439052
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	2.7339516872837737
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	7.69905918817515
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	3.1844967614118898
I salute Mr Schmidt.	9.19294952248087
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	2.631977377093916
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	4.942221854907234
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	3.4603113080286505
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	3.0859120234400605
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	5.536691887449975
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	4.19843499415025
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	3.611223144022
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	7.691480805580474
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	6.579461920544918
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	3.8591568307878634
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	4.684279979694123
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	3.403579418876262
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	3.3979899687485324
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	3.6382097632188626
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	3.816018635076751
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	3.791701142283723
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	3.338004411536355
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	5.591751555864612
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	3.4544486390110096
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	4.345898632223837
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	5.483881112104785
(Applause)	10.419226436654103
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations.	4.02382995912353
Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty.	3.6904707522253166
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.	3.9711665861053107
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	3.3887885667941413
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	4.1086826143254855
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	4.27454049232808
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	4.179200679108623
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	4.075723098632465
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	3.6520538858561298
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	3.342669521326642
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	4.058230477180449
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	5.325340082041854
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	3.973576222340005
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	3.503499804244668
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	5.221927587303729
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	2.8894768560604893
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	3.9028923682886965
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	5.044947558516447
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	3.3788022506351494
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	3.642312098247911
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	4.489973377459528
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	3.4519422841611602
However, I should like to stress INTERREG' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	2.7544772190585536
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	3.4953879908996934
We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history.	4.880024991097267
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	2.734012965486356
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	5.511658830509113
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation.	3.1573628736165675
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	4.87156640777616
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	3.7779052176929606
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	4.139946361798572
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	4.393818892038039
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	3.5920975249149305
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	5.07776134048473
The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	4.385875991108575
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	3.481533735028839
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	5.544769285528388
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	4.124095859475536
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	4.367255201745364
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	3.2368683537835836
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	6.225141222151905
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.	4.0432923853084235
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	3.38689169709718
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	3.8230680540210558
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	5.416997679695263
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	3.401857916555788
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	4.072664547014517
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	4.718592786986405
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	3.3750920882580586
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	3.3876987004341244
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	3.6746657482648666
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	3.5973990891968404
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.	2.943272525203147
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	3.9114725693594714
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	3.475700994668646
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.	5.262586398190532
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	162.61702368892693
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.	3.6601333667224196
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	3.934157269929576
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	5.490331940431725
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	3.125056233667794
We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	3.471825074731895
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	4.638476407676916
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	4.423829860070527
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.	3.380541394307161
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	7.316524438215195
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	3.889833663106396
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	2.4176815424382534
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	4.130879669744706
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	4.921788669906554
How many people found work?	7.434924465653694
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	5.048062224006214
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	3.7865775084304354
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	3.4691986567407396
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	4.406702283854063
Colleagues, you know the rules.	7.8171039276866985
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	3.7985151305994758
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.	6.266203206444279
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	5.096187044572216
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	4.365307499645491
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.	5.679573201478675
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	2.9577620023773727
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	4.033795715194314
Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union.	4.0551820846384015
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	4.277076657580612
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	3.896439055010724
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	5.3588135496801685
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	2.932230115442465
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	3.6497420019742886
the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	2.1645203071873684
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.	2.39752218113089
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0136/2000) by Mr Queiro, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Berthu, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	5.403576610426674
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	3.527266234473031
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	2.9761923026735726
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	4.010855661449576
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	5.46407451555502
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	2.8510227641097585
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	3.46060799580846
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.	4.42383615185165
I did not hide behind any immunity.	5.611831873620617
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	4.032412515290884
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	3.1386844261121287
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	5.961217071422168
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	2.46053944129489
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	6.561010583661164
Surely we should be more selective.	11.322487347595812
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	5.419411205163382
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	3.318488881448459
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	4.393708970913854
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	3.4567895966325715
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	3.995267661094814
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	4.6587229247478845
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	4.154104045978608
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	3.2924637957176817
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	4.137838124010584
At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them.	3.6853652739018035
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	5.18170941459712
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	2.764126653411576
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	4.769627779413544
They must be implemented without delay.	6.910558775362212
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.6926558162176746
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	3.9536719491054058
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	2.2210289862437085
Thank you for your reply.	5.6969784426829575
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	2.7929490747842265
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	4.091302523941628
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	3.4511633381790543
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	2.9733804392336816
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	2.605473755910294
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	3.6252035955220476
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	3.3047888529068414
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	3.576823231292039
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	4.282134109853365
Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources.	3.807587615646782
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	3.861586950764251
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	4.139451847793277
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	4.1919698126593
First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes.	4.138746695628478
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	3.4694877256172556
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies.	3.4943546655793045
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	3.615425866505126
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	3.8935709847008217
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	4.4739915127743055
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	4.476899741874985
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	2.6177399839963256
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	3.877346320813666
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	2.7729423627190455
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	3.9355583690488016
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	3.232566486603461
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	4.494701754126602
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	3.827197148440758
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	4.907812237782485
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	3.490296871057535
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	3.272199694974699
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	2.89251207018841
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	4.610614232529829
And therein lies the paradox.	7.658039469306198
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	4.398217892694637
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	3.5187702849456968
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	4.039217051595645
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	3.993695198125164
This is unacceptable to my mind.	7.789821390182538
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	3.2769694974697527
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	3.6838668226577327
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	3.5475426190445742
I would ask you once again to work on this.	5.421462249634496
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session.	3.005997350174898
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	5.2112453880119105
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	2.7206685042425343
In itself, globalisation is positive.	9.185134118279297
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	2.5540706765765573
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	5.369207234164289
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts.	4.872141311439312
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	6.0013867136243
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.	3.839814191518646
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	3.4171465831357506
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	3.7516633039103846
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union' s political will.	4.034629697245967
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	4.008699089112968
How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	2.796705478314492
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response.	4.122092068351056
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	3.1745029561943383
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	5.572606907223598
Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	3.4961579893867523
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	3.634633736514278
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	4.532392344350339
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	3.0227407680286924
We are a group of unity in diversity.	4.824629350162026
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	3.6105981350933956
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	4.826507685126612
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.	4.518693518582198
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	3.170489086403877
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	2.9969875445395964
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	4.730517863722488
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	3.337694407977134
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	4.279265849982116
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	3.448501878979894
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	3.4689056084874434
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.	3.921406443599359
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.	3.549848517393853
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	5.061034094331722
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	7.0904967512145545
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	3.663368129092297
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	4.2497026713951795
This service must therefore be kept public.	7.0747071166055395
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	2.8871212972343745
You have not integrated it anywhere.	6.327163502245933
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	3.0629165560200793
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	3.3597279315105446
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	3.0052483325231214
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	4.535356983662449
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	4.522134463710224
Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS))	2.2480112918572015
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	3.822477028231449
We need public and private investment.	6.648222431763907
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	3.576431198952842
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	3.273981315969898
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	3.391186388626152
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	3.149408792870674
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	3.7291326134384124
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	3.582930394830432
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	3.8194341792448467
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	3.900881214912325
I urge the House to support these changes.	6.28052378962104
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	3.197853936141797
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	3.034902291522799
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	3.5909650134771853
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	3.251505601628131
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	4.319224350869733
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	4.550971738721879
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	3.0238181366582544
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	3.5613369271118427
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.	3.068736008436204
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	6.765150143847562
So let us contact the United States now!	6.770019861133052
So how far have we come?	5.819597589827375
I just want to emphasise this further.	6.217992128955224
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	4.484314141941768
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	5.869130495433229
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	7.664935038483108
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	3.1082069001367745
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	3.6431976106989605
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	2.7752935897963242
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	3.5712378817191586
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	4.7969794598981395
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	3.165333774355288
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	4.403362242422241
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	3.0147265979698474
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	3.527334961979653
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	3.725932621375091
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	4.228294869980537
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	3.8754232935491624
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	2.4078567644901474
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	3.5325149203979507
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.	3.835418745132053
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	2.747370742248822
This is also an important point.	9.204367841143705
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	3.631443423714107
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	4.234590573395137
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	3.8109660681185966
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	5.200498205792374
That is something we would do well to recognise.	4.978987724781641
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.	3.777599091721382
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	3.6145271217360504
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	4.198125369089293
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	4.0131097344015885
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	3.460087104526084
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	3.7232485752240367
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	3.6280942239307694
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	4.900600149722342
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	3.933808123790113
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal.	4.305086222585706
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	3.8667507301699784
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	3.9296453004947813
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	3.0672476532224775
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.44114487168677
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	4.991892509282416
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	3.5286627023461694
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	4.393598676197302
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	4.228299367260066
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	5.263599279831785
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	3.9051508511093584
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	2.8437641022319617
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	4.1957535741196885
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	3.488167517326727
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	5.789224464162987
By now they are far away.	6.404436364787234
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	3.401711276155661
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	4.506920787837592
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	5.920034219199983
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	4.25447726260611
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	2.766610106977685
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	4.388175017015645
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	3.696522003362485
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	2.869187544195881
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	5.768635496763916
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	2.839731962128881
By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	4.504317404324285
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	3.7833185004908936
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	3.686494207357114
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	4.3336792629059095
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	6.714955839627842
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	3.201419362969303
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	4.576306854097075
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	3.115006554426934
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation.	3.9743055837832935
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	3.912879081033966
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	3.020852041107721
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	3.4311057613334572
It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace.	3.5308972582747056
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	4.110218547212059
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used.	3.1674715651440017
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	3.6194908999297937
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	4.352082598858896
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	3.1657601703114775
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	4.419856987040628
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	3.797153980048572
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	3.5423017722213848
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	4.978672366740464
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	3.519724553949425
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	2.6370404678562753
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	4.352829676416062
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	4.006624525671193
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	3.0762905875372497
Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	2.7901458081405983
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	4.880902224121164
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	3.2361169991613505
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	2.5054878925669004
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	3.4429278991421244
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	3.874752520215579
No-one would benefit from this situation.	4.8616054636945965
The debate is closed.	3.5669952632441104
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	5.425928873544312
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	3.8771407743585806
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	4.321998612901841
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	2.966735794718876
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	3.1616264795792235
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	4.28868554106549
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	3.3527603644811848
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	3.302883532699891
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	3.978044399439627
To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	4.071750914175154
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it.	3.1099168767464733
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	2.9260915434226873
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.	5.320452678603506
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	3.154358119825873
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year?	3.6418605841395157
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	4.021029616317716
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	3.5891885709175475
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	3.542827287936383
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	2.9582374389708805
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks.	2.9469585311996704
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	2.600218185141388
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	4.3148260654605926
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	3.48446275931215
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	4.011302212999772
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	5.582478619476122
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	4.0708318547967925
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	3.308929598816348
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	3.624368631033867
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	3.6639342297220874
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	4.854031488679535
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	3.0464686301904913
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	5.2679388188569005
. (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out.	4.207057709872772
However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	2.7534083887143694
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	4.555788759918344
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	3.095825929145188
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.	3.718554341910947
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	4.181301387431095
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	3.959751854021423
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	3.48729104795217
(Loud applause)	7.970654707605405
Madam President, on a point of order.	3.8032746208204644
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	3.504325186432362
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	3.711134426759679
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	3.711737899737171
Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	3.713003980257244
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	4.120938258305237
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	3.1981537839439933
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	3.2988261339605605
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	3.623923931577047
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	6.29436705605784
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	2.2008349414100805
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	2.9984640715518704
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	3.107373261617575
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	2.998195187183612
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	3.6439367308368578
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	2.9269136041279635
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	3.7433217742014184
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	3.0429504593964736
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	4.428246184566475
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	3.408013339984878
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	2.9597109428578836
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	4.228968847268777
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	6.395487648440797
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	3.6974787259363775
Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding.	4.1870835744392165
The debate is closed.	3.5669952632441104
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	2.89769071982843
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	3.3513351650294543
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	3.6309707496025108
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing.	3.1124400060553747
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	6.523465959048031
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	4.7724839496080715
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	3.069100682855673
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	4.739771762642699
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	3.250862944204303
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	4.609083992545077
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	2.9130548329327888
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	3.9115356931026626
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	3.8479870101486733
It is fine, in principle.	6.77755506799014
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	3.969244573346844
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	3.247560891382234
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	3.5104613858096063
It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	4.18073712701072
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	3.802407543792266
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	3.535275429383282
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	3.1911495366393154
Women in the decision-making process	9.408620061147237
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	6.097781926630359
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	3.5356967547023292
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	3.6158032457363842
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	3.6938026723111776
, rapporteur.	27.399564403684725
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	3.9601989375804987
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice.	3.686952873353684
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	3.8037635123051405
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	4.4109546242225
. (EL) The EU' s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in the form of a joint agreement as established by Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic.	3.323031265860117
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	3.1036718003221724
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.	4.048332637771624
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	3.471257507727122
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	2.803243028240656
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	3.882164670721086
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	4.868651115478411
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	4.221314217310606
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	3.68349608224357
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers.	4.1118806422605445
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	2.753400652551983
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	3.3588149323004144
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	3.847446864862377
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" .	3.1941130668168145
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	4.747597966107838
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	4.634625322373712
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	4.207147700774613
They have a much wider responsibility.	7.917698449958666
Congratulations!	157.5074395067822
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	5.706377859057025
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	4.629753174610122
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	3.233626221783916
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	2.7526530178825914
There is huge duplication of effort.	5.88772661573934
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	3.7482662726420903
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	3.9107855668851825
We share them.	12.970122004082395
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	4.2387653281969
We want to talk about coherence.	9.129353971641613
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	3.008173208409275
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	3.8930087068736667
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	4.7815112435789
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	3.4086897295162855
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	3.7867061202854333
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	4.020549183579894
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	3.5465164990399676
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	3.510695847307726
But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	4.988681322598141
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	2.518502062623841
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	7.098703115539879
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	4.007975009405203
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	4.931865291201082
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy.	3.188640313390222
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	6.13383325565421
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	3.2043276629533595
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	2.2008349414100805
So what should we do?	8.050272909433835
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	3.5836934177047066
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	3.7349278547194786
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	3.337037836301444
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	3.466138813451292
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	4.511653965357493
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	3.4326518318505186
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	2.477635902105285
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	3.593606117110508
Thank you, Commissioner.	4.993046106821185
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	3.6541549497615557
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	4.034165215611185
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	3.9991925570608555
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	4.355101712537213
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	3.660014472013675
These proposals favour women especially.	6.4825274191957645
By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice.	3.3991794243031928
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations.	5.723898845717959
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	3.994195477024988
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	2.4562006998169403
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	7.028566732883936
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	3.7084193537305694
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.	3.2805467943944486
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	3.467766441857714
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed.	3.7938578793669175
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	4.3023499526562645
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	4.203946817473742
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	3.561793841271098
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	3.659311426220572
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.	8.13880946207757
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	4.458796034706431
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	3.1153078663848572
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	3.1645453405992043
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	2.6486397793356984
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	3.4837950877191157
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.	3.795931911131147
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	2.989120676785351
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	3.4971484926213887
There is a limit to how useful that is.	4.382623136661126
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	5.378660038326485
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	3.916051874592725
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	3.430510070386396
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	4.286945946013264
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	2.0445127798109786
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	4.993216474395419
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	2.8620430459770403
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	3.605383509124963
He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.	4.120158956770476
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	5.301948021615599
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	4.33070317612289
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.	4.871697010003808
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	4.353989962280001
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	4.125777568811399
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	3.775921199093508
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	5.666013735382231
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	4.639559759215919
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	3.703610989047219
As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	3.131035381963626
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	3.3437934518234025
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	5.289513153302123
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	7.890052912965009
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	3.4717935526131503
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.	4.049266058356699
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	5.64850813251219
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	3.2839483330462627
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	4.523447661205465
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	3.074800805913802
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	4.739932689509515
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	3.3493326177076335
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	5.394051440517611
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	3.6384559827665037
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	2.333859492469545
However, some people' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators.	4.402679368326865
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	2.602269043243334
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	2.8427208527610306
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	3.5100974165234673
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	3.7078453685494925
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	4.598119237447388
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.	3.349121535040234
I am convinced that the rapporteur' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament.	4.0324353674605105
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	3.950492636681358
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	3.250842429327027
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	4.198789223035085
This is not the case here.	7.03985825791583
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	4.721384251088462
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	4.959457185646007
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	3.1488076090191277
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	3.4148842993807165
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	3.9332367694203136
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	3.4725398577168436
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	4.418524928815394
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	3.2690542901178765
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	3.2210876195227742
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	3.536491918864592
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	3.2449675644179847
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	3.182544006759016
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	5.163297079180693
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	5.407805886271364
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	4.019106018176701
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	2.631564099590202
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	3.745911443770348
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse.	3.3759800892158567
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	4.570846241527433
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	5.467896760364727
It is a miracle that they were saved.	10.6745390067829
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	4.196774105280036
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	3.4949486287354903
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	2.967570569060905
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	2.682566550908925
Not that we do so every week.	7.990957143662762
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	3.148965769999583
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.	3.6446786144290795
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	4.022500767535845
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	3.968902828329536
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	3.5939941441172247
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	3.877234188261879
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	3.899621370829103
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	5.997055211598901
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	4.300789596010779
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	3.2076624323460443
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	3.607814746382538
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	3.6797316864924716
It is about keeping communities together.	5.421669996264654
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	3.2701128803022734
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	3.5179940270882986
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	3.834440907590821
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	2.9653918956933523
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.	4.024772902111241
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	7.041904904355164
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	4.199420352858372
We are to get the agendas.	7.862388664531675
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	2.530013422171586
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	3.0531240490856852
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	3.5266201910975927
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	6.673780359150442
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	4.392701820662942
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.	5.096726814311465
Thank you, Commissioner.	4.993046106821185
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	5.736446987373593
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	3.9558863725571705
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	5.251933519863571
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	3.2006769042077727
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.	3.6191550357253512
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	4.017932531861335
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	3.5477753672721106
For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas.	3.665596933286311
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.	4.19625596423298
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	2.871804027424942
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	4.360264650140049
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	3.946543948082192
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	5.434038504945173
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	3.502512542518186
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	4.111108638290964
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	4.569941413096512
This I think is the new Convention.	8.688894272627726
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	4.349745156648119
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	3.339871185169429
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	3.9411334457251708
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	3.6957663173674193
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	2.652854097422232
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past.	3.980538312687916
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	2.853381883529064
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	3.8791693131248692
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	3.210266194862583
We await the outcome with great interest.	5.480847045765381
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	3.943168743848367
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	3.467555406248041
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	3.4968077168555514
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	3.345085396646101
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	5.942538697321109
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	3.4145688946349666
Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid.	3.0383679096856993
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	3.2650099251899936
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	3.2087086403736635
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	3.094686908835657
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	3.7895574173041653
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	3.9720580900738742
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	6.269782815075344
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	2.997720288965544
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	4.747847909553627
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	4.083839669714155
.	616.8147185758064
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	3.807871636764262
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .	4.285750774953244
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	3.923451791178806
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	5.7686891369635
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	3.333031924285627
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	3.0247318031253703
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	3.4532578089009363
As a political force, we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values.	4.221020601512563
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	3.0398759730044826
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	4.081293972458384
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	2.69036554546601
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	5.399409218682684
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	2.897857536569779
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	3.7204521455027733
This needs to be said!	15.219170640496715
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	4.301754784280489
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	5.182770837498683
This brings me to the content of the report.	5.053186416822245
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	6.167246242390883
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	4.0819195859005095
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us.	4.466602538716012
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	2.753632477444384
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	3.0549926698976924
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	2.609525577519515
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	4.480014145996625
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	3.956211589992565
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	4.124690010945513
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	4.847441923308275
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	3.7239536150771917
We cannot accept this.	8.011679016235442
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	4.398047218442691
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	3.8230205626761617
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	2.908743169721381
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	2.762785021448958
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	4.194645141708143
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	3.6145030688758606
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	3.6757148887974775
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	3.288110567869334
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	3.2667001510627474
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	5.143444935011497
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	2.8341494091639676
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	3.6904674028573563
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	2.8578436001968215
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	3.829548453613576
I think this proposal is a good one.	7.192023325830753
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	3.554706621577432
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	3.56260512867248
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	3.200063025470151
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	3.5118479414409314
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	3.418688131357663
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	3.1564953956404422
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	2.9305398203223834
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	3.4265526591862314
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	3.6851966771024753
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	2.8879363963782723
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	2.705211588463294
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	4.973944867608796
The post office is democracy.	8.433522820244681
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	3.8314451472782562
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	3.1769820221203022
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	2.8313585792267673
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	3.592647373045135
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	5.118152699498199
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	2.793250718795748
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	3.573326084789815
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	3.920931300151936
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	3.675429605790543
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	3.460649373306582
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	4.733656186270663
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	3.5578914678352422
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	4.208093312113845
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	6.643152791407241
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	3.6052069145564567
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	3.6615377504841424
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	3.6201820968629543
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	2.85904494241836
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	4.699491549211311
Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out.	3.042668605398814
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	2.853853098778253
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	3.655975924779223
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	4.246780062698056
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	3.1382956521870256
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	3.4598215029867974
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	3.413854991974209
To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty.	3.76316070252423
I do not think so.	5.248343747063953
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	2.5155602207199412
We must never forget to defend civil society.	4.0098770354784
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome.	3.5528669446632395
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	2.9762723964828766
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.	3.6684844173162254
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	6.02322224075974
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	5.117828193185009
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	5.106408771166234
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	3.178115338463533
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	6.921423229521245
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.	4.867575185965176
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	4.189381465681173
Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.	3.8461426282121693
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	3.538646920067456
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	2.7844778760407616
Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	2.7650334021632363
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	3.3672790186543944
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	4.161830036591264
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	5.607257337853212
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	3.528947617191415
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	3.356396256057431
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	4.005317249907085
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	3.2113999472539847
We must therefore find a political solution.	5.246633882919708
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	2.817111042258748
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	4.310029117640394
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	4.085662086227753
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	4.3489435827628435
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	4.097565669808428
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	3.7344518947029695
Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.	3.1748005176390537
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	3.3358918163555282
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	3.2312366179738605
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.	3.5955415945301596
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	3.028874613407677
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	4.404176801757606
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	3.6724629797541555
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	4.580571265170894
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	3.1660877347215344
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	3.229990504811574
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	4.01317396955956
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	5.030222959572167
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	3.334865444942404
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	2.2955253996140623
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	3.7135784514857373
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	3.124087803249975
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	3.715908897760829
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	3.122994862918059
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	4.0916455145325905
I cannot accept this.	7.655192457884398
With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application.	3.5721354164522756
But we shall have a decision very soon.	6.073473817885375
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	2.752438013481516
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.	3.2720715856384244
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.	8.790558639378464
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	5.753311793580778
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	5.842502693441546
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	3.6335116147907165
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	3.0923948909953816
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	4.871726169765496
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	4.279765528338113
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.	2.953986933810798
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.	4.893764643920436
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	5.261410970152525
The postal service is also the bus service.	6.836430725550988
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm.	3.314387459571066
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.	4.057141555956626
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	3.7149170650530734
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	3.74064340141982
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	4.908025755159487
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	5.020291495428231
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	3.426959124354654
We must put a stop to this trend.	4.748450594159441
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	3.278633395581782
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	3.4028980710644325
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	3.4575965825494825
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	3.84791905978253
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	3.63394648715586
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	3.7453327050435328
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	6.091318581964465
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	6.778082863730468
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	4.599743446266422
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	2.772893638591259
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	3.7015807877658005
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	5.444053790291224
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	4.306387872276732
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	3.533717126879009
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.	5.212592310594116
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	3.753347339661383
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	4.766037448395721
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	3.4118199535610625
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	3.705658161970698
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	4.223977342575799
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	5.884579907179791
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	3.5366922707819475
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	5.547717784661383
By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States.	2.9750193395234112
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	2.0149976451618734
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements.	3.8866786040754517
- (PT) Although this Community initiative, LEADER +, follows on from previous initiatives, it has some unique features.	3.432668967480929
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	3.697125889042961
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	3.50800884717927
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	3.9784774689648126
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	2.6151945583771914
The next item is the joint debate on:	3.22215156878247
This is not the usual state of affairs.	4.921572462946042
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	4.576942155664222
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	4.005991368246064
What are we doing about it?	5.9159333752181755
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	4.073040596950851
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	4.433259088644504
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	3.352945889516719
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.	6.839493225662901
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	4.419398926650803
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	3.06714548190995
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	6.508039188759479
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	2.166692607423953
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	3.777000433713426
It seems contradictory.	13.13911397572278
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	4.605645841493051
Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington.	3.9677706286214054
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	3.3924418999517583
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	3.5950343649108802
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	4.416706246311719
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	2.932531492451057
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	2.8931187167005086
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	3.5262455284824075
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	3.95937914405798
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'	3.2190232710320155
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	8.495660528533742
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	3.5381700776420613
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	3.2389370274994267
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	4.520562891643539
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	3.589767383973795
The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	3.4023719925601883
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	5.4259831445727045
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	6.994138976454368
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	4.617723952814506
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	2.7411441755488335
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	3.5584488816926374
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	4.866371933907757
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.	4.623770318408899
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	3.2200272645886248
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	4.8641695263012235
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	6.316651547314873
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	5.535750156926785
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	2.8448141354261853
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	6.26169661007273
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	5.671539814584229
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	3.2845161964289504
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	3.825425484794609
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	3.344146445436034
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	3.3530725893677733
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	3.4598331754530345
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	4.150128483178454
You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	4.80286577399951
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	3.5592378881137106
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	5.903984083651756
Today' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome.	4.244359861089762
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	3.4537076632413077
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	3.6809828293189466
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	4.671129176243316
You did not call me either.	5.972418110283842
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	4.991682448659611
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.	5.1029227406201105
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence.	3.3904982816358635
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	9.763192747930335
